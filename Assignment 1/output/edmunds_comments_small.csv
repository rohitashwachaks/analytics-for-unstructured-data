0,"March 24, 2002 10:54PM",merc1,"I personally think that with a few tweaks the C320 could also sit at the top of this group. It's still more of a entry-level luxury sedan than Mercedes would lead you to believe. The C320 ""Sport"" needs to have it's suspension retuned to accept 17 inch tires without a harsh ride. MB also needs to stop forcing metal trim and black leather on everyone that wants the sport package. The C240's 6-speed wouldn't hurt either if offered on the C320, though it needs to be ""fixed"" first.

That said, my favorite of the group is (gasp!) the new A4 3.0. The A4 easily has the best interior of any sub-40K car, combine that with stunning looks and a body that is as rigid as any ever made and you have my personal favorite. The single thing I don't like about the A4 is the grey trim around the bottom of the car. This trim doesn't match any of the body colors, as it should be body color anyway. This is an excellent car and in my opinion the best there is under 40K. The upcoming A4 Convertible, Coupe and S4 WILL all be winners.

The BMW 330i is now an old favorite, but I'm (of all people) starting to tire of the 3-Series just a bit, save the M3 variants. I was kind of dissappointed by the 2002 facelift, they could have done a little more in the way of styling. I hope they do a little more for 2003 with the coupe models.

The Acura TL-S is easily my favorite fwd car in this class. Wonderful engine (you actually can hear it) and decent handling for a front driver. Nice price, seats and what not, not hard to see why the TL is so popular. This car's main faults are styling and obvious cost-cutting in the interior, stereo, fake wood etc. Otherwise a standout.

Lexus ES300. Nice, but not my type of car at all. This is one for the Buick set. The IS300 is half baked, but has a wonderful chassis. Styling is also in question here, it simply doesn't look like a 35K car (grown). The interior is gawd-awful. Bet on the next IS300 being done right from the start. In their defense Toyota didn't initially intend for this car to be sold in the U.S. so it was a rush job.

The CTS holds the greatest unrealized potential here. I've seen several now, and each time I see one they look better and better. Again like the C320, IS300 the car has interior issues. The dash feels like it was made by Rubbermaid. If you're going to be stingy with wood trim, why bother? Half of the steering wheel in wood, and very little anywhere else in the car??? The seats are very good though, as is the handling. A work in progress.

The G35 looks like it may have a winning chassis, but the interior, though clean looking seems to be styled about 10 years ago, lots of square shapes and flat surfaces. Another great engine, waiting to drive this one.

Don't really care much for the X-Type. If I were a Jaguar man I'd be truly pissed at Ford and Jaguar for this one. They are actually selling a fwd X-Type in England and I've read where they're thinking about selling it here! Hell no. The car should have been rwd not awd. Some will tell you that this was done to compete with Audi. Thats BS, awd was the only way to keep the car from being fwd, WITHOUT spending the money to convert the car to rwd. It is a good looking car though and that Jaguar ""leaper"" will be enough for some, but this car has to grow on me.

The Chrysler 300M is about as close to an Audi that American cars come. This new 300M ""Special"" is truly a good looking car inside and out. One problem: Where is the performance???? A 255hp car *in this class) with a 0-60 time over 8 seconds is not accpetable. Something is not right here. Some say engine, transmission and/or gearing, but whatever it is, Chrysler needs to let some MB engineers have a look at this car. The heavier E320 with less power is faster. I still like this car, but it's no lust object once you get past the great styling.

1,"March 25, 2002 12:06AM",fredvh,I am debating a new purchase and these two are at the top of my list. The price difference between these two is approx. 6K (non-Type S Acura). Is the ES300 worth 6K over the TL? I don't know because I have never owned a TL but I am familiar with the ES300(previous generation). Supposedly the 2002 ES300 is a lot better than the previous generation but is it that much better than the TL? Of great importance to me is initial quality and overall dependability. Does the TL compare with the ES300 in both of these categorys? I am not familiar with the Honda Co. Are prices lower than Lexus for service work? I would appreciate any input on this dilemma from some TL owners.

4,"March 25, 2002 5:44PM",riez,"One beauty of BMW 3 Series is that there are so many models to choose from. Almost half of all buyers in America don't get the basic RWD 4 door sedan. Besides having 3 engine and 3 transmission choices, you can get coupe, convertible, AWD, station wagon, and super-high performance M-Series!!!

hungrywhale... I concur that having the availability of a manual transmission across the line is absolutely critical!!!"
5,"March 26, 2002 1:20PM",blueguydotcom,"good grief, so you wait 9 months for the manual. Even with an auto, I prefer to every car listed and I NEVER have owned an auto and never thought I'd enjoy driving a car with an auto. That's what value, performance and an exceptional engine can do for a car. Once the G has a stick there is not another sedan under the M3 that I'd consider."
6,"March 26, 2002 2:02PM",hungrywhale,"I'll give it a fair shot when the manual comes out, but I'm just flat-out not interested in an auto. I don't care how fast it is. It's not about the speed, it's about the driving experience and having more control over the car."
7,"March 26, 2002 2:45PM",blueguydotcom,"I understand it's not about the speed. I really don't care if the car won't do over 100 as I rarely break the century mark. What I do care about is power and with the manual mode on the auto, I can get it when I want it. Will I buy an auto-equipped G? In all likelihood, no. I desperately want to drive the 6 speed."

Infinity G35(Tons of BFTB, good luxury, but completely boring exterior and even more boring of an interior)

BMW 325(very little BFTB, excellent handling/build quality/resale, classy looking but too conservative for me)

Riez, I read from your profile that you have a manual BMW 5-series. But I think you are wrong to not consider a car such as a Infiniti G35 to be a serious contender as a performance luxury sedan. From your logic, then the BMW 3-series (your wife's) or the 5-series with the Steptronic should not be contenders either. That's belittling the Infiniti, Audi, Lexus, Acuras, BMW's etc. with automatics.

When I return in December from Qatar, I plan on purchasing a sports sedan. I'm leaning on the G35, but the BMW 330i along with the Audi S4 are also contenders. IMO, if the handling of the Infiniti is as good as the BMW as some that drove it has stated, then it will hard to pass up especially for the price. Also my first choice will be a manual, and Infiniti should have the manual out by December. I will test drive all three, manual and automatics, and make my choice from there.

I do agree with you that manuals are more fun to drive, and that will be my first choice. But, automatics in this category, especially those made by BMW, Infiniti and others, should not be eliminated as performance sedans. Different flavors for different people.

I have been following discussions on many boards and what I have been noticing is that there is so many ""experts"" on what is the best sports sedan. And most haven't even driven the competitors to give an honest opinion. This is not aimed at you Riez or Shipko, because your profiles states that you own a BMW already. But from what I noticed is that some BMW ""supportors"" don't even own a BMW, (at least not from their profile) or they state that they never drove an Infiniti G35, but they still make ""unsupported"" facts, assumptions or opinions on such. (See the Edmund's BMW 3-series discussion). I hope in your defense, Reiz, that you drove the automatic Infiniti G35, to give an opinionated statement that it doesn't classify as a performance sedan. I value your opinion and others as well.

Again, I'm not flaming you, but I try to be an informed consumer before I buy anything. That is the reason that I will drive every car that I'm interested in and make my choice from there. I'm also always interested in those opinions from people that own the type of car I'm shopping for and at least drove it, so they can give valid pro/negative statements.

Cheers!"
13,"March 27, 2002 10:00AM",hungrywhale,"I think what riez and I are trying to say is not that automatics perform poorly or that only weenies drive them

But any car that truly holds itself out as a performance sedan NEEDS at least the option of a manual tranny. Manuals are always faster than automatics and they are almost always the choice of the enthusiast driver.

There's nothing at all wrong with automatics, but I sure don't want one."

15,"March 27, 2002 11:23AM",dave330i,"In this class, the best bang for the buck has to be IS300, assuming one can live with the styling.

I guess I'm one of the few that likes the old A4 styling to the new. Isn't the new A4 pushing 3600 lbs. now? That's pretty heavy for this class."
16,"March 27, 2002 12:06PM",blueguydotcom,"Even at 29k for a 35k msrp IS300, I passed on it. Now I never drove a manual one (they weren't out yet) but even with a manual, given the car's horrible drive-feel, poor interior and lethargic steering, I don't think I'd go near one. They're not up to Audi/BMW/MB/Infiniti."
17,"March 27, 2002 1:42PM",wishnhigh1,"Never liked a lexus, and probably never will. I would rather drive the CTS. There is always something that irritates me about them. I would buy the IS as a Toyota but not a Lexus...I personally think Lexus should have a car in its lineup with this cheap of an interior and with this much sporting character. Toyota deserves something like it though.

Also, I don't think 215 horsepower for 29k is a lot of bang for the buck, considering the G35 is the same price with 260 horsies."
18,"March 27, 2002 1:46PM",dave330i,"""I would buy the IS as a Toyota but not a Lexus""

How else are they going to get that extra $5k from you then?

Reasonably equipped G35 goes for $33k or so."
19,"March 27, 2002 2:10PM",riez,"I couldn't have said it better myself. I'll let you lead services!

mbarto... I most certainly will test a G35 manual if and when it finally comes out. I promise!!! Automatics make nice luxury sedans and maybe even sporty luxury sedans. But NOT performance sedans or luxury performance sedans. (I don't even consider the 540iA Sport truly worthy, though it is as close as one can get in an automatic. If I could just get my wife to drive a manual....)"
20,"March 28, 2002 12:43AM",mbarto,"Thanks Riez! Let me know when you do. I'm sure you'll get a chance before I will since I won't return until December. I am curious of how it compares to the BMW's. YOU can speak from experience, so I'll value your opinion.

It does make a difference being married. (LOL! see the latest discussions on the Infiniti G35 vs BMW 330i board). First, I'm fortunate to have a wife that can drive a manual. Not that she prefers that, her first choice is an automatic. But she appreciates the hard work and sacrifice I'm doing out here, and knows that this car is for me first, family second. Of course, it helps my cause when I let her buy a new dining room set last month, and new living room drapes this month. Bribes do help! Whatever I finally decide, I'm sure she'll be happy."
21,"March 28, 2002 5:07PM",riez,"mbarto... As regards the ""bribes"" issue, you've figured out one of life's great truism: You get what you want so I can get what I want."""
22,"April 5, 2002 3:34PM",cybersol,"So if someone were looking to purchase a new performance luxury sedan today, what cars would they HAVE to take a look at and test drive? Lets say they only had time to look at five?

What five would they have to look into?"
23,"April 5, 2002 5:16PM",riez,"Since it has to have a manual transmission and should be RWD (AWD/4WD adds too much weight and complexity) and has to be fun to drive hard...

1. BMW 3 Series manual
2. Lexus IS300 manual
3. Cadillac CTS manual
4. Lincoln LS6 manual

If you want affordable and can go FWD, then add Nissan Maxima 6-speed with LSD and maybe Altima 3.5SE 5-speed.

Try to get car with LSD. Inline 6s are magnificently smooth engines.

Possible future car: Infiniti G35 sedan when it finally gets the 6-speed manual."
24,"April 7, 2002 8:22AM",coolguyky7,"The TL should be up for redesign in a few years so a TL would be outdated in the not so far future. And besides, it seems like everyone who drives an Acura drives the TL. I LOVE the ES300. Some say it looks bloated; I don't think it does. At the 3/4 angle, it looks impressive. The interior is as nice as a car can get. If I had the money, I would buy an ES300 in a heartbeat. I never did like the past ones' boring styling...especially since the last two generations were nearly twins. Go with the ES. Besides, Lexus' quality is ahead of Acura's."
25,"April 7, 2002 3:59PM",kdshapiro,"The new ES is a very smart looking car. Notwithstanding any engine issues though, I think there are direct price competitors like the I35 that offer better overall value on paper. Now I haven't driven either new model, I did drive the older ES300 and it did it's job very well. They are both great cars. Lexus for legendary reliability and resale value, Infiniti for up-to-date features."

28,"April 9, 2002 2:43PM",blueguydotcom,"Go drive one. They're a blast and for the money they're a steal. If someone wants entry level performance luxury at a great price, the G's really tough to beat.

29,"April 11, 2002 3:06PM",steffie2jc,"I can't make a decision. I was set on the MB C240 but then I read some postings from people who got lemons. Now I am starting to think that the Audi 3.0 CVT front wheel drive is what I shoud get. Any advice? Low manintenance is what I am looking for.
Thanks!"
30,"April 12, 2002 7:53AM",merc1,"Well I'm a Benz fan first and foremost, but the A4 3.0 CVT just offers more for the money. The A4 has a better interior, the top A4 engine (compared to the C240, which is the base C) and it's styling is at least as good as the Benz if not better. Both makes pay for scheduled maint during the warranty period. Neither car will be ""low maintanence"" after the warranty runs out, especially the Audi with it's fairly different transmission. If you're priced these cars and they've come out equal go for the Audi it's the better value here.

M"
31,"April 14, 2002 1:09AM",popovs,"I think both are excellent(sp?) cars, however neither one is a low maintenance automobile. That is to say neither brand is known for low maintenance. What they do offer is luxury and performance in an aesthetically pleasing package and, some would argue, a superior ownership experience.

As someone has said before, every manifacturer makes lemons - some more than others - but the internet is not the best place to find information about that. Most people are just venting and are not representative of the owner community.

Although I can not speak as to the driving merits of the cars, I suspect that they are similar since I've heard (read) good things about both the A4 CVT and the C240. Something to keep in mind is that anytime a new product is offered by the industry, it usually takes a couple of years for the company to work out all the bugs in the technology.

Both cars are relative newcommers to the market. The facts that they are made by distinguished companies and use proven powerplants does not speak conclusively as to how reliable the cars will be as a whole.

Since you are already looking for alternatives to the MB because of reliability concerns, it may be worth your time to look at other alternatives than the Audi. As someone has suggested in the Help me Choose! forum, try looking to Lexus for the answer. They seem to make reliable cars that are also cheap to keep running. Of course now we get into the issue of European vs Asian luxury ..."
32,"April 17, 2002 2:23AM",popovs,"It has come to my attention that as of late MB has taken a hit in its reputation. People have been quick to point at the recent survey results - both European and Domestic - that say Mercedes is no longer reliable. These surveys show that statistically speaking MB has as much as doubled the amount of repairs that they do under warranty. I won't deny these findings, but I will try and justify them.

1st and foremost, MB has and is comming out with newer designs every year, updating the cars both inside and out. Anytime that a new product makes its debue it takes a couple of tries to get all the kinks worked out.

Secondly, according to mbspy.com, Mercedes accounted for ~half of the profits by DCX last year. I think MB is being used as a cash cow to keep Jeep and Co affloat, thereby driving Mercedes to cost-cutting through corparate pressure. Lower quality parts equal lower overall car quality.

These two should get things going ... Feel free to agree or disagree."
33,"April 17, 2002 12:37PM",mvargo1,"There is not much to debate on this subject. If you want a reliable car you buy Japanese. If you want a drivers car you used to have to buy european. The Japanese just do quality better and more consistantly than anyone else. You also get a lot more car for your money with a Japanese vehicle. There was a time when the europeans built the best driving cars in the world. Sadly for them those days are passing. The Japanese keep building cars that are closer and closer to european driving dynamics (IS and GS series Lexus(Lexi?), and Q45 and G35 Infiniti's) While the europeans quality especially Daimler/Chrysler just is not keeping up."
34,"April 17, 2002 1:11PM",wishnhigh1,gave up nationality based generalizations a couple of years ago.
35,"April 18, 2002 4:12PM",cybersol,"I'm interested more towards performance than luxury. Also value is an important component for me. Although I have the money to buy these cars, I also have other fun things and places to spend it. I'm looking to buy the car and keep it for around 7-10 years. Its very sunny with no snow here as well. I also want an automatic or CVT(gasp).

So right now, the five I am going to look at more closely are as follows:

1) BMW 330i
2) Audi A4 3.0 CVT
3) Infiniti G35
4) Acura TL-S
5) Nissan Altima 3.5 SE

The BMW represents the top of the class, but it also has the highest price. The Altima represents the most performance oriented family car, which is a cheaper class of cars. The BMW and Altima will bracket the value equation. The other three all have the potential to compete for my dollars.

Cars that are missing, IS300 too small, while the styling of the CTS, S60 T5, and 9-5 Aero are not for me. The ES300 and I35 don't have enough performance for me. Everything more expensive than a comparibly equipped 330i was also excluded.

What do you guys think? Anything missing?

Thanks,

36,"April 18, 2002 4:50PM",riez,"cybersol... I can't fathom why you would want to go with slushbox, but that is your loss.

Comparing FWD to RWD is like apples to oranges.

Not sure what sort of real price range you are looking at. The 330i with options might push $40,000. You might really consider the much less expensive 325i. An Altima 3.5SE with few options might have a $25,000 MSRP.

Read Motor Trend's review of I35. Their's had more than enough performance. 0-60 mph in 7.0 seconds, fastest in their comparison test. And it can be had with a Sport Package. But you might be better off with a loaded Maxima SE or GLE, saving thousands off the I35.

You might also consider Volkwagen Passat. That can also be had with AWD. If you like AWD, the Jag X-type should be on your list.

From the domestic corner, you might also consider a Lincoln LS 6 or 8. Or Chrysler 300M.

Surprised your list excludes the Mercedes-Benz C-class.

And if you can live with a FWD automatic, a loaded Camry or Accord V-6 or Avalon might be acceptable near the Altima's price range."
37,"April 18, 2002 6:07PM",cybersol,"Sorry to disappoint with the slushbox, but if we were all the same life would be boring (and there would only be 1 car type).

I would prefer RWD, but the best FWD's (torque sensitive steering) are getting close enough to bring the acceptable price premium for RWD down. Price range is 25-40K as you mention.

Passat, 300M, 325i, are too slow for me. The C Classes are either too slow or more expensive than the BMW. I would choose the BMW over the X-type, as they are similarly priced and I live in sun country.

The maxima (better value than the I35) is a good suggestion, and I am considering that equally with the Altima at the lower end.

My wife loves Camry's, but I'm looking for excitement. slushbox or not.

Thanks,
cybersol"
38,"April 18, 2002 7:14PM",kdshapiro,"The new Altima is great as my friends just bought one. However, dollar for dollar I think the Maxima is the over-all winner for a FWD car. If you can live without the amenities of the I35 the GLE with leather, sunroof, BOSE can't be beat. I've owned two Maximas. Me! I recently made the jump to the 330i, and it's been worth every penny. However the G35 owners are very passionate about their choices. For a couple of dollars more than the Maxima, hovering around the I35 I guess, the TL-S can't be beat either.

I understand when it comes down to it, you pick what you think has the right combination of value, performance, luxury and the right type of car for you. For every person it is different. When I got the BMW I was cross-shopping SUVs, mini-vans, and FWD passenger cars to see what struck my fancy, and I was ready to get an Explorer."
39,"April 18, 2002 7:18PM",riez,"cybersol... Excitement and slushbox don't seem to be compatible. I can't get too excited about FWDers. Certainly not a slushbox FWDer.

Not sure what you mean about ""the best FWDers (torque sensitive steering)"".

Very powerful FWDers tend to suffer from severe torque steering. Use of equal length half-shafts and limited slip differential can help, but not completely eliminate. The laws of physics remain. When the drive wheels and steering wheels are one and the same, and you have a powerful motor, you'll get some torque steering.

Do you have kids? Plan to in near future? If not, have you considered any coupes or convertibles? They can be a bit more exciting."
40,"April 19, 2002 8:28AM",dave330i,"""Excitement and slushbox don't seem to be compatible.""

Agreed. Unfortunately, most American drivers don't seem to get it. They care about silly stuff like 0-60, 1/4 mile, hp & torque numbers, but choose to miss out on the fun part of driving."
41,"April 20, 2002 1:18AM",cybersol,"Riez, you have heard of speed sensitive steering? This varies the power steering boost as with the speed. Acura claims to have torque sensitive power steering on the TL-S (not the TL though). This would supposedly vary the power steering boost with the torque being applied. And that in theory could eliminate a large amount of torque steer found in powerful FWD cars. It still doesn't eliminate the FWD tendency to under steer due the the drive wheels being the same as the turning wheels."
42,"April 20, 2002 9:49AM",riez,"cybersol... There are two types. Those tied to engine output and those tied to road speed. I have heard that the latter are superior, since you can vary engine speeds (RPMs) a lot, depending upon gear being used and speed, even while driving relative steady speeds. Better systems vary boost on road speed, since you normally need more assist at low speeds, regardless of engine RPMs.

Here is all that the lengthy full-color TL brochure says: ""Steering: Variable Power-Assist Rack-and-Pinion"". This is off the tech specs on page 30. I cannot find a single mention of the steering system anywhere else in the brochure. So if Acura thinks its variable assist power steering system is special, they are keeping it a secret. This large brochure covers both the TL and TL Type S."
43,"April 21, 2002 12:36AM",cybersol,"Yeah, I have that brouchure and they don't mention the difference between the TL and TL-S, though they say both have variable power assist. They do not say how it varies.

But on the Acura website. TL -> Specifications -> Body/Suspension/Chassis it says:


Steering Type

TL Type S - Torque-sensitive, variable power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering

3.2TL - Speed-sensitive, variable power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering


Here's the link if you want to check it out:

http://www.acura.com/model_TL/tl_spec_results.asp


Hard to find, but not a secret."
44,"April 21, 2002 6:50AM",riez,"cybersol... From what I've read, the better variable power assist system is tied to road speed, not engine RPMs. Once you get a car up to 25 mph or more, there isn't much need for assist, even if your RPMs decline due to turning or downshifting. And certainly once you hit 45 mph or more there isn't much need for assist no matter what happens to your RPMs.

But keep in mind that torque steering isn't due to the steering system. It is due to other factors. Can be very pronounced in powerful FWDers. Corrective actions include limited slip differentials and equal half-shafts. Need to provide equal power simultaneously to drive wheels.

From standing start, floor your car. See if the wheel pulls in one direction. You'll have to correct with the steering wheel (to keep the car straight) but by then you'll have already encountered the torque steering.

45,"April 24, 2002 7:51AM",beartrax79,"So, if you read through most of this group, alot of references went out to Audi... give a guy a hand here and compare an Audi A4 3.0 to an Audi S4... I see a difference of about $5K, 30hp, and a sporty suspension. Why shouldn't I load up a 3.0, rather than going after the S4?

Oh, and does anyone know on possible improvements for one or the other for 2003?"
46,"April 24, 2002 5:15PM",cybersol,"Have you driven them both? The S4 really moves. Even by Audi's own 0-60 times the S4 manual is 1 second faster and the S4 tiptronic is 1.2 seconds faster.

Yet, the S4 is currently based on the 2001 A4 platform, and it is scheduled to be upgraded to the new platform in the 2003 model year. Expect the performance difference to increase as the indications are that the new S4 will pack 300 or more hp.

Hope this helps."
47,"April 25, 2002 12:36PM",beartrax79,"I've tested the 3.0, not the S4. Hmmm... new S4 in '03, huh? Maybe I should just wait. What do you think, cybersol? Right now, th3 current S4 states 250hp, yes?"
48,"April 26, 2002 9:50AM",cybersol,"Yeah, the current S4 has 250 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque. The torque is fully online by 1850 rpm. So this is why it scoots.

The new S4 should be really nice. If you have the time to wait, it might be worth seeing. It might move up in price a little if the performance gets closer to the BMW M3, but then the old S4's should be easier to pick up at a good price right as the new ones are coming out. So many decisions.

Have fun making the right one for you!"
49,"April 27, 2002 2:37PM",1pierce,"Not so fast. There is merit to the ""nationality based"" debate. Let me explain to you why Japanese cars have higher quality (in terms of reliability) than American or European cars. The reason is cultural.

Americans have always had an adventurous, entrepreneurial spirit. We take chances. Its not in our nature to ""accept"" things as they are. I think this is somewhat genetic, since the vast number of us are descended from immigrants - aren't we all, really - people who took tremendous risk, and had great courage to brave the unknown for the promise of a new and better life. As such, in areas of design, we bore very easily. Americans are always looking for the next great thing, the next new design, the next technology breakthrough. Europeans, especially Germans, are like this about cars, if not about everything else. The US auto industry is always ready to chuck the old and start over from scratch - witness Chrysler and Ford over the last two decades. As such, our products are usually stylish and inventive, but not very refined - see minivans, SUV's, cab-forward, night-vision, etc..

The Japanese by comparison have a culture that is traditional and thousands of years old. They have made an entire culture out of honoring tradition and the status quo. We had to yank them kicking and screaming into the 20th century after world war II. I know this is somewhat simplistic, but bear with me. What the Japanese are good at is taking an idea and refining it year after year, until it is near perfect. There is very little innovation or risk taking. That is why the cars are so bland. When was the last time you saw a new technology invented in Japan? VCR's, computer technology, cell phones, the microwave oven...all American inventions that are better built by the Japanese. The same goes for cars. Most innovations come from the US or Germany, with some safety innovations coming from Scandinavia (give up the turbos and 5-cylinders, already those are as refined as they're going to get!).

Anyway,...when you distill it down to its essence, this is why Toyotas and Hondas never break. Its also why they are no more than transportation appliances. And, this is why the best performance cars from Japan will always be knock-offs (albeit sometimes very good ones) of something somebody else does better and more originally.

I'll step off my soap box now, and await your wailing."
50,"April 27, 2002 2:54PM",wishnhigh1,"The problem is that they are HUGE generalizations. Also, you are talking Japanese as almost exclusivly Honda and Toyota. What about Subaru, Mazda, Isuzu, Mitsubishi, Daihatsu, and Suzuki? So far the only makes that seem to keep with that Japanese Culture are Toyota and Honda.

And many American and European makes are now capable of having higher quality than more than 70% of Japanese cars. Doesn't help your generalization that much, does it?

So where do the generalizations stop? They should stop with brands, and not nations."
51,"April 27, 2002 7:38PM",kd6aw1,"Have found out that with some of the more powerful cars like the G35 or Corvette the difference in performance from a practical standpoint isn't really an issue because these cars are faster than we can ever dream of driving without either killing ourselves or getting tickets all the time. I have an automatic G35 and love it. Being that it is an automatic I can enjoy my coffee, shave, talk on my cel phone and hug my wife while driving in rush hour traffic.

====================================

Those cars in general reflect the perfectionist attitude of 1pierce's post. With virtually no exception, the overall quality of Japanese brand cars, especially fit and finish, considerably excels the American brands. From what I have read, this is due to the attitude of Japanese management in not accepting mediocre craftsmanship. Not the abilities of the assembly line workers. You may have a point though, that some of the Japanese brands show as high a level of innovation as the American and German brands. After all, which country has used the Wankle rotary, and Miller cycle engines? And who introduced us to the VTEC engines etc?

American management leans strongly to the bottom line and CEO bonuses, with refinement and polish falling by the wayside as a casuality of the heavy handed management style."

58,"May 28, 2002 7:50AM",rayainsw,"I beg to differ.

While I admit that I am biased (obviously, since I bought one!) I believe that the W8 is really a performance sedan.

I test drove the G35, and several BMWs (and a few others) before making my final choice. I suppose the term &#145;performance sedan&#146; could be defined in any number of ways. For me, the W8 offers everything I want &#150; and nothing I don&#146;t.

(Isn&#146;t that a recent Nissan &#145;tag line&#146;?)

Take straight line acceleration, for instance. VW literature quotes 0 &#150; 60 in 6.5 sec. To me, this is pretty quick for a 4 door sedan. My fearless (?) prediction of future test acceleration numbers is: 0 &#150; 60 in 6.5 sec., as VW claims. And a quarter mile in about 15.0 at 94 / 95. I base this on a number of things. For instance, in the May 2000 Car and Driver comparison that included the Lincoln LS8 Sport and the Audi A6 2.7TT, the Audi tested had virtually identical curb weight as the W8, identical final drive, wheel / tire size and Tiptronic. The HP / TQ for this Audi were 250 / 258. And their test results were: 0 &#150; 60 in 6.6 sec. and the quarter mile in 15.1 at 94. Thus, my W8 with 270 / 273 ought to do slightly better. We&#146;ll see. . . (BTW: in the same test, the Lincoln LS8 Sport they tested turned in acceleration numbers of: 0 &#150; 60 in 7.5 and the quarter mile in 15.7 at 90. This was my previous car. So, it seems reasonable that my W8 feels quicker &#150; setting aside the notorious un-reliability of everyone&#146;s &#145;butt dyno&#146;!)

Does it pull the same lateral G as the G35 or a BMW 3 series w/Sport Package. Almost certainly no. But with more aggressive rubber, I expect that it will provide enough grip for entertainment value at any sane public road speed.

Just my opinions.

59,"June 4, 2002 12:13PM",cmnott,"I recently went through the list of entry level cars...I was in test drive heaven!

325i - very nice car, best shifter/clutch of all, but not enough power for me. Great motor though as fas as smoothness. the interior is average, nothing better. With leather and wood it helps but you either dig it or you don't.

330i - same as above but better power, although I find the power to be linear. You can really move in this car but the sensation of thrust is lacking. I like that sunroof and leather are std. Better value overall than 325i plus std. 17"" wheels (although with all-seasons). Pricy.

IS300- Nice manual tranny and smooth motor. That's about it. hate the interior, feels claustrophobic and chintzy.

X-Type - I liked the 3.0L Sport, but did not like the grey stained maple. Didn't look like a jag. Very nearly purchased a 3.0L British Racing Green with Ivory Leather and beautiful walnut but with options this car is riciulously overpriced, makes the BMW look like a bargain hunter. Too bad, nice motor and very good manual tranny and ride. Brakes were strong. One thing about the motor was it just didn't feel or go like 0-60 6.5 as advertised. Nicest interior overall.

A4 3.0 - Porky, ponderous even with sport package. Did not feel swift and easily the worst tranny available in this segment. Nice interior, leather was only average. you could barely tell the difference between the leather and leatherette, which is a good thing if you are cheap, but bad if you opt for leather. By the way, the leather in the BMW was much better.

S4 (2001)- Nice but not as fast as I thought it would be (I did drive a 99 Mustang GT). It rockets off the line but it isn't that impressive afterwards. Nicer seats and support but interior is too gloomy. 250bhp and 258 lb ft. motor is not an audible delight, the 2002 A4 3.0 sounds amazing compared to the S4. I think the backpressure has gobbled up the exhaust note. An exhaust would be perfect here. They were giving them away (9000$ off MSRP - and people were definitely buying!) but it just looked dated now beside the new ones.

G35 - went and looked at one in showroom and was not impressed and without a manual tranny, I wasn't interested one bit. I still managed to drive one and was impressed with the torque, it definitely had thrust that the others lacked (except the S4). Nice seats and neat touches for rear passengers. I really liked the dynamics of the car but the tranny left me cold. The fit and finish was poor, maybe it was an early model...no dicker sticker which made it cost as much as the A4 3.0 and BMW 330i was close.

Lincoln LS V6 - very good handling and crisp 5 speed. Engine was thrashy at high revs which is particularly bad because it needs to be revved to really move. Torque is lacking here. But I liked the car overall, especially with the Sport susp.

Acura TL-S, another auto tranny but an incredible motor, definitely my favourite V6 of all of them as far as sound is concerned. Interior average and handling so-so. Excellent price.

Volvo S60 T5 - I chose this car for its thrust (come to think of it 3bhp less and 15 lb.ft less than the S4 is quite close to the S4, and it is lighter) FWD torque steer is evident only beyond 8/10ths, but it is there, no question about it. Best seats, best stereo, average steering feel falls behind the Jaguar and BMW. Brakes while strong are grabby but it takes getting used to. Amazing power and style. Seems decent off the line but after 100km/h it easily pulls the hardest. Price was also a consideration as it was cheaper than BMW, Audi, Jaguar.

Didn't drive the CTS but I am sure it is excellent.

In conclusion these are all excellent cars and even though we all nitpick this and that on all of them, I would be fine with any of them in my driveway. Honestly."
60,"June 4, 2002 2:27PM",blueguydotcom,"I had the grave misfortune to drive a CTS, and it's not in the same league as the Bimmer, Audi, Infiniti or even the lesser Acura/Lexus/Jag.

The CTS i drove was a 5 speed sport model with a sticker of 38k (gasp!). The tranny was rough, very rough, almost Mustang bad. The interior felt cheap with lots of hard plastic and very little in the way of substantial or soft-touch materials. The throttle response was weak and required excessive modulation of a rather awkward gas pedal. The car's a rolling bed of 1998 technology, no automatic brake distribution for one thing. The salesmen kept insisting 4 channel ABS is impressive...to each his own. Handling? Nothing at all like the claims car mags are making. It was a slow reacting boat...turn the wheels, feel the car undulate and then slowly shift directions. Not impressive in the least. In fact when the salesguy asked me what I thought after the drive I told him the CTS wasn't even a real competitor to the germans or japanese. He snorted and reminded me, ""This is a caddy, not a sports car."" Yeah, well that Caddy can sit on the lot with the other heaps they have."

62,"June 5, 2002 8:11AM",cmnott,"Hey blueguy, what wrond with the Mustang tranny! I know it is not a FWD type gearbox but when you have 300 lb.ft. of torque twisting that car, you need a strong tranny. In all honesty, the clutch, while incredibly easy to modulate was hevay, but with a purpose. never missed a gear either, which can't be said about the A4 6-speed...

jagboyxkr, I know you have an X-Type and I was right in there to the end with this car. Bottom line was 10000CDN difference. The way they package the options is ridiculous. i needed the split fold seats, but they were bundled in a $2000 package. Xenons? Twice asmuch as any other car, $1600.00. Sunroof? another 1600.00. It was unbeleivable but the lease rate was very low (1.9%) which helped make up the difference.

I don't care what anybody says about the X-Type, because most have never driven them, it is IMO, a better overall car than the Audi. In Canada, AWD is recommended...this car gets slaughtered because of its high price. This car should have been priced equal to the leader of the class, but to price it more than the best car in the segment is suicide in this hot market.

The T5 is broken in nicely, I have over 2000 miles on it now and it is everything I expected. What i didn't expect was the sheer power this thing has after 100km'h. I think it would beat my Mustang at that speed in a rolling start, no question. i would even say an S4..."

Cmnott, I respect your opinion about the jag and the audi 3.0...although I strongly disagree. I guess as a 3.0 owner I would. I personally found the jag x-type to be the worst car I have ever test driven. First, it was $3000 more than the Audi. Second, well it is a ford and felt like a ford. The handling in no way compared to the 3.0. The interior might ""look"" a little better but certainly did not ""feel"" any better. AS for performance, I am a little dissapointed with th 3.0 and I think they could have used a 250-260 hp engine to solve the problems. However, it is still a fun engine...especially at highway speeds. I honetsly felt that the Mondeo (excuse me, x-type) was going to fall apart on my test drive.

Now I know Audi has had its problems but not even close to comparison with the negative headlines for the x-type!

Oh well...to each their own! Enjoy your T5!!!"
70,"June 27, 2002 9:10PM",jagboyxtype,"I came to a different conclusion about the Jaguar X-TYPE 3.0 and the Audi A4 3.0 Quattro. I was considering both vehicles, and it was very close, but the Jaguar won for me.

ACCELERATION:
In acceleration times, the Jaguar is clearly faster than the Audi. Car&Driver states of the X-TYPE, ""Subjectively, the X-TYPE didn't feel quite as quick as a BMW 330i. But a few instrumented acceleration runs revealed that the measured 0-to-60-mph time of 6.3 seconds was only 0.2 seconds slower than the small BMW. We would rate the smoothness of the X-TYPE's V-6 to be similarly close to that of the Bavarian in-line six.""

Road&Track says of the X-TYPE's performance, ""In acceleration, the 3.0 X-TYPE is among the quickest. Accompanied by a nice-but-distant exhaust note, the Jag goes from 0-60 mph in 6.5 seconds, undercutting the boy-racer Lexus IS 300's and Audi A4's 7.1, the Mercedes C320's 6.8 sec. and matching the BMW 330i's time.""

-Jaguar X-TYPE 3.0 acceleration times: 6.3 - 6.5 sec*.
-Audi A4 3.0 Quattro acceleration time: 7.1 sec*.

* = manual transmission.

HANDLING:
Of how the cars handle, R&T says of the X-TYPE, ""Whether the chassis is redolent of Jaguar tradition or not, no one complained that it didn't work. It feels like a modern, well-balanced sports sedan with excellent highway ride and good balance in the corners. Every time we got into a long stretch of fast, curving mountain road, whoever was in the Jag inevitably got on the walkietalkies we all carry and said, 'This thing is really good in the curves!' It's a confidence-inspiring car, with good grip, linear steering, and precise turn-in. The engine is not bad either. Our test car's optional 3.0-liter 4-cam V-6 (there's a less expensive 2.5 version as well) put out a respectable 231 bhp, keeping it in this fast company with no particular effort.""

They also say of its suspension, ""Jaguar engineers told us they wanted the suspension to be 'connected but relaxed,'and that seems to wrap it up nicely. The ride is about as smooth as you'll find in this class, even with the Sport suspension. Given its soft ride, the X-TYPE delivers surprisingly good handling.""

Of the Audi's handling, they say, ""Dynamically, the all-wheel-drive car is not as crisp as it looks. It handles well enough and has a superb highway ride, but it accomplishes these goals in a rather soft and rubbery style of suspension tuning and steering...In short, the Audi is missing that firm, rally-car edge and sense of steering precision that makes the BMW, for instance, so delightful to drive. It's a car that can keep up with the other sports sedans, but doesn't feel very sporty doing it, despite our car's having the optional sport suspension for $750...We noticed in some of the whoop-de-dos and curves of our desert highway that the Audi produced 'considerable excitement,' as one driver put it, and was simply more floaty and loose than the others. And again, 'This is where you pay for that great highway ride,' one driver noted. The 3.0-liter 220-bhp dohc aluminum V-6 is smooth and reasonably peppy, though well back from the front of this pack.""

STEERING:
Motor Trend says of the X-TYPE's ZF Servotronic II variable-ratio speed-sensitive rack-and-pinion steering system, ""The car's best system may be its speed-sensitive rack-and-pinion power steering. In fact, it matches the previously unrivaled precision served up by BMW 3 Series. Car placement feels laser-guided precise, with excellent feedback and road feel. With complete confidence and comfort, we drove at most times with just our fingertips - even at 120 mph on the track. The only all-wheel-drive car we've ever driven offering similar levels of steering communication is the Nissan Skyline GT-R, a pretty racy piece.""

The Audi's steering was criticized again by Car & Driver and Road & Track for being, ""rubbery"" in feeling, and C&D said that the ""steering wheel vibrates at peak engine revs.""

Car&Driver also says that the steering system of the X-TYPE ""is nothing short of terrific."" They call it ""enthusiast goods"".

Forbes even takes note of the steering system in the X, ""Jaguar engineers boast it's the best steering system they've ever had on any model. We agree.""

ALL-WHEEL-DRIVE:
Audi is known for its Quattro AWD system, which has been develped for over 22 years now. Quattro IV its newest version, and is used on the A4. It divides power 50/50 to the front and rear wheels unless slip is detected, and is known to be one of the best systems available. Torque steer is said to be very minor, and it is said to work well with even the turbocharged 1.8-liter 4-cylinder versions of the A4, although it is noted by some to feel heavy without the larger V6. Audi also used Quattro to prove that AWD in certain racing conditions could be better than other setups, and later was banned from using AWD cars in certain races because of its advantages.

Jaguar uses a new AWD system they designed called Traction 4, which divides torque 40% to the front wheels, and 60% to the rear unless slip is detected. This, along with specially designed roller bearings fitted between the tops of the front strut towers and the body, along with its advanced steering mechanism, give the performance and feel of a RWD car. Unlike most AWD systems, Car&Driver said that Traction 4 produces no torque steer to interphere with the purity of the steering.

Forbes stated of the X-TYPE's AWD, ""The X-TYPE gets a seemless, virtually transparent new 40/60 viscous coupling all-wheel-drive system with optional dynamic stability control that rivals Audi's vaunted Quattro for wet- and dry- weather grip.""

Road&Track said that, ""...The Jag is better balanced. It will understeer during turn-in, take something of a set, and then pull you through. It's a safe and secure feeling that signals what's about to happen and gives you plenty of time to adjust""

BRAKING:
The X-TYPE features the same vented front and solid rear discs as found on the larger S-TYPE.

Road & Track said, ""In braking tests, the X-TYPE had impressive and easily repeatable stopping distances from 60 mph (118 ft.) and 80 mph (208 ft.)"" In another one of their articles, they say, ""The braking distances turned by the X-TYPE are exceptional, comparable to those of top sports cars.""

Car & Driver also said, ""A few laps at the Castle Combe racetrack allowed us to explore the outer reaches of the X-TYPE's handling, where it proved completely benign, thanks to the all-wheel-drive. Even at the limit, understeer never grinds the front tires excessively, but the only way to get the tail out was to flick the steering wheel while simultaneously lifting the throttle. The four-wheel disc brakes proved linear and powerful under repeated heavy track use.""

By comparison, a BMW M-Roadster stops from 60 mph in the same 118 feet as the Jag. The Porsche 911 GT2 stops from 60 just two feet shorter than the Jag, at 116 feet. An SLK32 AMG does"
71,"June 27, 2002 9:10PM",jagboyxtype,"it in 127 feet.

-Jaguar X-TYPE 3.0 braking distance from 60 mph: 118 ft.
-Audi A4 3.0 Quattro braking distance from 60 mph: 137 ft.

ITERIOR:
Here is where the statements become subjective, and anything I say here other than what is quoted from others is just my opinion.

Both the Audi and the Jaguar offer excellent interiors. The Jaguar goes for the warm-looking British cabin that its family members also display, utilizing massive amounts of wood and Conolly leather with bits of chrome; the Audi has a German, functional design that is still inviting with clean lines and details. I really like the interiors of both cars. The Jaguar has the best leather and wood, but a few things like the plastic of the Audi's air vents seems more resilient, etc.

Road&Track said that, ""Despite the lower-than-XJ price, the X-TYPE sports the traditional Jaguar upscale cabin...The simple round gauges have an easy-on-the-eyes green backing on the instrument faces, there's birds-eye maple trim scattered around the cockpit, and the seats are tasteful and comfortable...The Jag's interior is a rich assemblage of shapes and textures, done up with nice details like the silver-rimmed green-faced gauges."" They say it ""may be an 'entry level' model, but you wouldn't know it judging by all that leather, wood, and the easy to use nav system.""

Motor Trend says the X-TYPE ""has great styling inside and out"", and says specifically that the interior is ""soothing, luxurious, and reasonably sound from an ergonomic standpoint. The main instruments are nicely detailed and easily readable through the steering wheel. HVAC and audio-system controls are housed in a centrally mounted horseshoe-shaped binnacle, which allows lots of genuine maple veneer to span the entire dash...It's pure Jag inside and out.""

Car&Driver says ""As you'd expect, the interior is lined in sumptuous Connolly leather and bird's-eye maple wood trim on the dashboard and doors. Luxury amenities abound, as well as the expected front, side, and head airbags...The level of finish is very nice with neat stitiching, close fits, and excellent materials throughout.""
_____________________________

eaweg-

My opinion is that the Audi and the Jaguar are both great cars, but that the Jaguar offers more. It is more expensive than the A4, but it is more expensive for a reason. It is known to outhandle the A4 and outperform it in acceleration and braking, and it has the most rigid chassis in its class, 30% more than the previous class leader. AWD is also standard, as well as Connolly leather and wood. You must have had a bad test car if yours felt like it was going to fall apart, because everything I have read and experienced with the X-TYPE says that it is very solid with high-quality materials throughout. Like you said, to each their own."

""Quality problems bedevil Jaguar's X-Type; two drivetrain issues cited""

...Jaguar Cars Ltd. is at risk of alienating its newest group of owners, many of whom complain their new X-Type sedans have an array of irritating quality snafus. While none of the problems directly affect safety or operation, they are of sufficient annoyance that some first-time Jaguar buyers say they're ready to bolt the franchise...

...There are two separate drivetrain problems. During deceleration from about 70 mph, a high-pitched whine will come from the all-wheel-drive differential unit. That problem is so widespread that Jaguar has issued a technical service bulletin to its U.S. dealers.

The fix: adding mass to the differential-mounting bracket.

But the cold weather noise is another matter. It occurs anywhere from 20 mph to 70 mph. For some owners it goes away quickly; others have the tuning-fork sound ringing for minutes at a time.

This problem has been the most bothersome to owners because Jaguar Cars has not officially acknowledged it exists.

Some owners say they have had several prop-shafts replaced under warranty - one American owner says he is on his sixth.

Steven Miller, a 41-year-old attorney from Long Beach, N.Y., suffers from both drivetrain problems. While he says he loves his X-Type, Miller is frustrated by his dealer's inability to repair the problems, despite three visits to the service bay. ""I made a tape recording of the noise,"" Miller said. ""The attempted fix was to put some sort of additive into the all-wheel-drive system. This quieted the noise for several days, then it came back."" ...

75,"June 28, 2002 9:41AM",cmnott,"Congrats on your A4!

Look, no question you were quite gracious about my comments about the A4. I was so disappointed with the new styling because I always wanted the previous A4. So to see how it looks, personally, I hate it. maybe it is just me, but I just couldn't come to grips with it.

I found the A4 felt slow reacting whereas the jag had better reflexes. but also felt smaller. i think it is unfair and untrue to say the ""Ford"" thing, I think that has been addressed, whether people choose to beleive it or not. The 6 speed was poor, there is no other word for it, but i really did enjoy the automatic (as far as one can).

the jaguar had a much, much better transmission but I was not particularly enamored with the clutch. the steering, IMO, was better than almost all. I just couldn't justify the price difference when a certain car is TRYING to make an impression in a hot segment.

Like i said before, there are no losers in this segment, but I think it is safe to say none of us would go for the winner of the comparo, eaweg and jagxboytype!"
76,"June 28, 2002 11:39AM",jagboyxtype,"I totally agree that it is all personal preference, and I really believe that most all of the cars in this segment, especially the A4, S60, and X-TYPE, are some of the best. I don't think there is ""a best"" car here since everyone has different needs and preferences. They all have their own ups and downs, but I think the benefits of each of these cars certainly outweighs most of their negatives as well.

On the X-TYPE article:
I read that Autoweek article too, and it scared me a bit before I went to check out the X-TYPE and made me check the competition before going with the car in the end. Jaguar seems to have solved most all of those problems in the current X-TYPEs though, and the ones being produced now don't have any of those problems. I also found two articles in my local newspaper that were on early X-TYPE problems. The initial article was much like the Autoweek one, and the second one came out a pretty long time after the first one; it was a follow-up on how those initially unhappy customers were doing after Jaguar North America finally contacted them and worked on their cars. They had factory technicians go out and examine the cars and all of that - they even bought back a car and gave the owner a much better new one. Jaguar was a bit late in contacting them (and I agree that it took too long), but they did get most all of their X-TYPEs fixed and the customers ended up being very pleased with their cars in the end.

Yes, some of the very early production X-TYPEs lived up to their old Jaguar reputation for being problematic as the article shows, but the newer ones are much better both in quality and reliability. Jaguar did many things and worked hard to correct the faults of the early cars, and they even had the Whitley Engineering Center, who designed the driveshafts for the X-TYPE, go through five or six different new designs until they finally got it perfect.

I can personally say from experience that the X-TYPE is not in any way a problem car, at least the ones being produced now, especially as my own car has had no problems at all. It initially had the drippy windshield whiper jets, but the dealership simply tightened a valve on the underside of the hood before giving me the car, and nothing has gone wrong since I've had it. I really love even just being around the cars as it has been so good.

Again, it is all personal preference. When I sat in the Jag for the first time, it just felt right. I hadn't even adjusted the seat and it just felt so perfect. Every time I sit in it, everything is perfect. The whole car is that way for me, and I bet your Audi is the same for you.

And if anyone is paying off the media it's BMW and Infiniti, and it appears that Infiniti is paying the most. I don't think Jag even has the funds to do that:-) (Although, global sales were just up 62% in April, and they've had record-setting sales for the past four consecutive years now.)

And, it is very nice to speak to someone civilized on this board. Take care of your car!

Blueguydotcom-

I actually own my car, we paid the dealer in full when we got it. The only incentive for the X-TYPE is a pretty good lease price (I just checked yesterday), but even that has been complained about and called false advertising by many as it is only for the 2.5 litre model with no options (not even paint is included in the advertized price for the lease!). It's also ending in a few months, and then prices will be even higher. I'd like to see how people complain about it being very expensive when the 2003 prices come out, as they are even higher than this year. Oh well, it is a Jaguar after all, and a great car on its own. Option packaging has been reorganized for 2003, however, so getting things like sunroofs is easier."

78,"June 28, 2002 5:48PM",jagboyxtype,"The X-TYPE is Jaguar's fastest selling car right now, it accounts for over half of all Jaguar's sales, and it has boosted Jaguar's global sales by 62% since January 2002; and that number was recorded from April. In February of 2002, Jaguar's U.S. sales alone were up 105% compared to Feb. 2001, largely because of the X-TYPE. X-TYPE's sales have been taking off after a slower start since the events of 9-11.

Recorded in May, 16,171 X-TYPEs have been sold since January 1, 2002 in the U.S. Of that number, 2,961 were sold in May. Jaguar is very happy with its sales. Also, the X-TYPE is supposed to be lower volume than many of its competators as it is a Jaguar. Never the less, this compares well with 16,395 Audi A4s and 16,339 Volvo S60s sold so far this year. The Infiniti G35 has only sold 8,731 units so far, and 11,237 Cadillac CTS's have been sold in 2002 as well."
79,"June 30, 2002 7:00PM",eaweg,"Thanks to you both for your great chats...I agree with jagboy that it's nice to see people talk about things without acting like ""my dad can beat up your dad""...my only knowledge from automobiles is that I have a passion for them. Mechanically I am okay...just enough to get by.

It's funny, after I got my Audi the Volvo dealer that's 5 miles form my house had a great deal one week later. Yes I was miffed for about 24 hours but like the both of you I think my personality fits my choice.

You are absolutely right about there not being a loser in this segment. For those who get the G35, more power to you...so you can beat me in a straight line...if racing was what I wanted I would have gotten a used S4 and modded it to about 340hp...but I really couldn't see myself doing that for at least the next 4 years of my life. For some reason I have a sneaking suspicion that something negative is going to come out about the G35...I just can't pinpoint it thought. The '02+ 3 series are just plain ugly with the new facelifts.

Cmnott, as for the 6 speed, yeah it was pretty ""odd"" the first couple of months. I can honestly say though that it has brolen in and that it is worlds better than when I first got it. To think that the 5spd manual in the 96 Saab 900se that I had before it was actually better!!

You said, ""The Infiniti G35 has only sold 8,731 units so far.""

81,"July 2, 2002 12:05PM",jagboyxtype,"My point was that the X-TYPE is selling and that there is a larger amount of them on the road right now than there are G35's or CTS's. Blueguydotcom had asked about its sales numbers and had compared how he had seen few X-TYPEs on the road but many more ""Bimmers, Lexuses, G35s and CTSes"". I just threw in the other cars' numbers to demonstrate that although he may have seen more of some of the other cars, in actuality, there are more X-TYPEs that what he has seen.

Also, Infiniti sold 3,298 G35's in May 2002. Since its introduction in March, it has sold 8,731 units as recorded in May. Assuming that around 3,298 units would have been sold in January and February had the car been introduced earlier and had a start in sales numbers for January 1 like the others, it would have sold about 15,327 units (3,298 + 3,298 + 8,731 = 15327)."

-The SportCross takes on the 3-Wagons. So do the A4 Avant, V70, C-Class wagons, and the soon to appear X-TYPE Touring.

-The S4 takes on the M3. There is also a C32 AMG. Later, the X-TYPE R will also join that crowd.

-The A4 Cabriolet takes sales from the 3-Convertibles.

-An A4 coupe is on the way, as is the G35 coupe to take one the coupe 3-Series. There are still IS300 coupe rumors, too. To a lesser extent, the C-Class coupe takes on the compact 3-Series in Europe.

And to top that off, the new Saab 9-3 is a sedan now with a normal trunk.

By your thinking: ""You could almost include the Z3 roadster in the mix, as it shares engines, transmissions, and platform parts"", I guess we should include the Camry in the ES300's sales volume since they share those same parts too. How about all of those Jettas, Passats, Beetles, and Golfs that come with that 1.8T engine in the A4? Maybe those should be included too."

I drove several '02 325xi's and A4 3.0 Quattro's, and both had their +/-'s. The 325, though, lacks even the most fundamental standard options (no power seats on a $30k+ car!?!?) and has a way to go on the interior design (cheesy exposed cup holders that look like they belong in a Pontiac). Not to mention the 325 has 30% less power to spin those 4 wheels.

The sad thing is that virtually all luxury sports sedan reviews compare a $40k+ loaded 330 with a $33k A4, and the 325 is declared the de facto winner as it rides on the tails of the 330. The whole ""3-series"" nomenclature is nonsense.

93,"September 14, 2002 5:42PM",rpawlak98,"I beleive the handling of the BMW is slightly better because of it's small size. I would like to see how it would handle if it were a midsize car (like the Infiniti G35 or Acura TL).

The amount of 'points' that are giving to the BMW for it's handling should be removed for it's size. This is a sedan! It is not a sports car. When talking about sedans, sufficient room in the car should be seen as an important factor.

I'm sure they could make the BMW even smaller and get even better handling and performance from it. If they did that, it would be hard to justify it even being in this category."
94,"September 14, 2002 8:18PM",kdshapiro,"rp - you are correct the 330i is a sedan, just like the G35, just like the Acura, just like the Audi and all of the cars that were compared in the latest Edmunds round-up. None of them are sports cars. Edmunds calls them Entry Level Luxury Sport Sedans. The fact is the 530i also gets very high marks in the performance department, except the 530i is a true Luxury Sport Sedan, again not a sports car.

Now the 530i outclasses all of the above in terms of amenities, but it would be interesting to see from a strict performance viewpoint, how it compares to the above or even compares to the 330i.

Although in the scheme of things size has little to do with performance - as another poster pointed out there are cars the same size as the 330i that are nowhere near it in terms of overall performance. Note the salient word is overall.

Also the fact that it is a compact has nothing to do with it's interior room. The G does not have marginally much more room and if you read Edmunds round-up, it does state there is sufficient room in the car for 4 adults in the 330i. Unless you regularly transport 5 people and the two people in the back seat absolutely have to have the reclining seats, in my opinion the amount of extra space in the G doesn't make that much of a difference. It might to you, but then you get to vote with your dollars. If I regularly transported 5 people however, none of the cars in the Edmunds round-up would be on my list.

It seems clear to me based on the reviews I've read over the last couple of years, when only talking about the sport of driving in this segment, the 330i is the benchmark."

Here are my thoughts, and I'd appreciate comments from others:

325i pros
fun to drive and handles well
like the sound of the inline 6-cyl. engine
holds its value well
nice safety features
good reliability record

325i cons
many on the road
styling not that exciting any more

Mercedes C240 pros
styling (in my opinion)
solid as a vault
nice ride and handling
safety features

C240 Cons
slightly underpowered
quality concerns (at least from early models)

Passat GLX pros
great looks
cheaper than BMW or Mercedes
decent power and handling
safety

Passat GLX cons
dealer service (from what I've heard)
seats not the best (in my opinion)
soft ride (i.e. not a ""sports sedan"")"
97,"September 16, 2002 12:29PM",kdshapiro,"Add the following cons to the Mercedes and VW:

- in my area there are many on the road, diminishing the value.

Seriously - I think you have to focus on what's important to you. Is fun to drive, hold's value and good safety features important? Or is styling important and the fact there are many on the road an important criteria because you want a unique vehicle.

Just as a suggestion, if you phrased the question differently rather than giving your opinion about the importantance of certain car attributes you might get some very meaningful responses.

For me important questions might be:

1. Has anybody had any reliability issues with any of these cars? How did the dealers respond?
2. What do others think about the seating in the vehicles?
3. How much did people pay?

Good luck with your decision."

I'm finding that it's very hard to judge reliability from the internet message boards. I've read horror stories on the internet for all three cars. People with problems are more likely to post a message than those without problems. Consumer Reports recommends all three cars. I personnally know one person with a C240 and one with a C320 wagon. Both love their cars, but haven't had them too long.

I made a mistake with my current car and am determined not to do it again. I want to get something I don't mind paying for, want to keep for many years, and want to keep shiny. The problem is all three of these are great cars."
99,"September 16, 2002 2:38PM",techhawk,"These are three pretty different cars, so it really comes down to what you value. The Passat is a real bargain with the nicest and largest interior as well as elegant exterior styling. I looked hard at a GLX and W8 when I was shopping. The handling is pretty wallowing, and the power is just adequate (I'm a leadfoot ).

The 325i is fun and rewarding to drive, really nice handling and ergonomics. Its pretty small and the price goes up fast as you add options, and its also underpowered for my taste.

I've never driven the C240. The C320 I drove was nice, but not terribly sporty and I was disappointed in the quality of some of the interior pieces (they need to see where VW gets their switches).

All three a very good cars, I could be happy with any of them based on my needs."

101,"September 16, 2002 6:55PM",techhawk,"The TL-S does have boring styling and white is its worst color. It fairs better in darker colors. The overall performance is similar to the G35, though it gets edged out in most categories. The biggest difference is FWD vs. RWD. I spent quite a bit of time in a TL-S when shopping recently. I chose a G35, but if you are a Honda fan or prefer FWD the TL-S is a great choice. It will also run you a little less than a comparably equipped G35, and you can probably get a deeper discount to boot. There have been concerns about the TL-S having tranny failures, but Acuras tend to be very reliable.

For direct comparisons of the G35 and TL-S look at the recent Edmunds entry sport lux sedan comparo, the C/D currently on news stands (I have to admit its not very credible to me) and the July 2002 R/T. Good luck with your shopping."

Sedan, coupe, convertible, wagon, and ultra-high performance models. AWD and RWD. Automatic and manual. Choice of engines. Is it BMW's fault they are so wise to spread their costs across so many variants and give buyers so many choices? I say you could also add Z3 sales to the mix, too!"
109,"September 21, 2002 6:13PM",jagboyxtype,"Oh, that's too bad. It's also too bad that they failed to notice that:

-The X-TYPE does have an indash CD-player, which is standard on 3.0 litre models.

-Out of the group of European sport sedans (e.g. BMW 3, Mercedes-Benz C, Audi A4) the Jaguar X has the most powerful engines.

-The Jaguar Alpine sound system is rated very highly. The auto's section of my newspaper rated the Jaguar Alpine system the top system out of premium European cars in a big comparison test of car stereos. Lexus won the Japanese premium car sound system category with its ML system.

-The car is a wonderful handler; for example, it outperformed the C-320 Sport in that deleted post comparison, and although it does not have the class-leading acceleration times, it is only about 0.2 second behind the 3-Series and is in the top end of its class when it comes to performance (0-60 in 6.3 seconds - Car&Driver; 0-60 in 6.5 seconds - Road&Track). With its AWD, it can corner like no other car.

-Braking performance from 60mph is just two feet longer than the Porsche 911 GT2 (116 feet), at 118 feet. Thus, it stops in the same distance as a smaller BMW M-Roadster (118 ft.). Brakes are from the larger S-TYPE.

-Connoly leather and wood are all standard in the Jag, and leather and wood are only optional (if available) in competor's models.

-It has the most rigid structure in its class, over 30% higher than the previous class leader.

-Synthetic interior materials (e.g. plastics and not-leather soft-touch areas) are made by the same company from the same materials from the same machines that manufacture synthetic materials for Audi's A6 and new A8, which are ""industry leading"" according to many.

-The X-TYPE does weigh a little more than a RWD car as it carries an extra differential and drive shaft for its AWD, but that doesn't seem to hurt its performance. It actually helps it in many ways. Also, for instance, it weighs less than an Audi A4, Cadillac CTS, and Lincoln LS.

-There is some engine noise entering the cabin, but even wispers are still audible from passengers. Plus, it's a sports-sedan, so the engine is supposed to have a nice little note to it. Many reviewers have enjoyed the sound the X-TYPE's engine makes. There is also almost no wind noise as exterior mirrors, etc. were sculpted from windtunnel tests at Pininfarina and high-speed tests on the Nardo bowl in Italy as well as the Nurburgring in Germany.

-Clutch: yes, some people dislike its feel, yet others like it because it is not difficult to use. I believe that it was MotorWeek that stated it felt like a BMW clutch.

-Pricing: you can get a base X-TYPE for around $29,000 - $30,000 with leather and wood, manual transmission, metallic paint, etc. Option packages have been re-organized to allow more individual options to be ordered. Competators like the MB C-Class sedan start at around $31,000 without leather and wood, but vinyl and plastic.

About the only virtue the X-TYPE doesn't have are memory seats. Beyond those, it's one hellofa car. I doubt it would still be making up 56.7% of Jaguar's sales and dominating an unheard-of 66% of its market in Europe (especially Italy) if it weren't a great car.

On the Acura transmission problems, only 16,000 cars have been afficted with the problem over the past two years, according to the posted article. Accura sells a lot of cars, so it does not seem to be a massive or wide-spread problem. Hopefully they'll fix it, but I wouldn't worry about it too much."
110,"September 21, 2002 7:57PM",riez,jagboyxtype... Have you been reading what European Car has been writing? I'd encourage you to read their articles. They have a web site. I didn't write them. Please don't shoot me. I just passed along what an interesting source said. I happen to agree with many of their comments. Not all. And I hope Jaguar works aggressively to improve the X-type.
111,"September 21, 2002 8:47PM",jagboyxtype,"""Please don't shoot me.""

I wasn't trying to shoot you. You are just being paranoid. I never even mentioned you in my whole response except for in the title where I was directing my message to what had been said that you passed along. I said ""they"" as in the editors of European Car, but if you are now using the ""royal we"" and took what I said as directed towards you, now you know that is not how it was meant. I will shoot some words at you about improving the X-TYPE, however, as I don't feel the car needs any improving at all except in a very few minor areas, such as memory seats (not that they are really needed, but it would be a nice touch). Everything that makes a Jag is there in the X-TYPE, and it is a great car on its own. Naturally, Jaguar will improve the X-TYPE just as it improves all of its cars. As for your fear of being shot at with words on this board, perhaps you shouldn't say things that would cause you to get shot at if that is a fear of yours.

BTW, every month, over 3,000 people just in the U.S. disagree with you and with European Car about the X-TYPE. Sorry buddy, but you're in the minority on this one. However, European Car's own final words on their X-TYPE test were:

""Pushed to the limit and the X-Type will gently push until you ease off the throttle. Muscled around the track however, and its possible to slide the sedan until the tires melt. Great fun!

I came away from the X-Type totally surprised. I expected to find a meek and mild sedan but instead found a serious contender in the sport-sedan market. These first two offerings are great!...I can't wait to see what those rouges at Jag's R division have in store for the X-Type."""
112,"September 22, 2002 2:10AM",affy,"Why isn't Audi considering shipping the A3, S3 here, i belive there's a lot of market potential here in our shore. It make perfect sense to have a A3 to battle against the Benz C-230 coupe and the BMW 320i. I saw picture of the A3 and it look ok, right now i'm considering to purchase an A4 3.0, i want to comapre the A4 3.0 and the S3. Audi should ship the lux-golf here!"
113,"September 22, 2002 6:08AM",riez,"jagboyxtype... Ya gotta stay calm. Did you notice in your most recent post you did write ""over 3,000 people just in the US disagree with YOU and with European Car about the X-type.""

Have you even taken the time to read what European Car has written? Or what MT and C&D have previously written? The X-type has gotten mixed reviews at best in America. Don't believe it has ""won"" a single comparison test. See R&T's recent 11-car sport sedan comparison. Think that says a ton when X-type falls short badly in comparison tests.

Can you steer me to an American comparison test in which the X-type won?

And what do sales have to do with how truly good a sport sedan is? I see a lot of people driving Malibu, Taurus, I30, ES300, etc. To many (most!) people a car is either an appliance or a status symbol. But it is only the rare few who are truly interested in all around performance. Some people might argue that low sales are a better indicator. Most people want cushy ride on interstate, not 0-60 times or slalom results. The IS300 crowd might wear their low sales as a badge of honor."
114,"September 22, 2002 6:26AM",riez,"jagboyxtype... Do you read MT or R&T?

Check out the November 2001 issue of Motor Trend. MT pans the X-type 3.0 AUTOMATIC in their 5-car comparison. In 10 areas of their ""Report Card"", the Jag wins just one, styling. Has last place or 2nd to last place rating in powertrain, ride, interior design, seat comfort/support, rear-cabin space, trunk useability, and value. Track results mediocre. Fourth place 0-60 mph time. 2nd slowest slalom time. Worst braking result. They tested a moderately loaded $43,695 one.

Check out the July 2002 issue of Road & Track. R&T pans the X-type 3.0 MANUAL in their 11-car comparison. X-type comes in 10th overall, 9th in just subjective ratings, and 10th in just performance ratings. They tested a loaded $46,510 one.

Does that mean you disagree with me, European Car, R&T, and MT? Wonder if you and the other 3,000 people are reading what is out there? And test driving the X-type against its competitors?"
115,"September 22, 2002 8:10AM",merc1,"Isn't that comparo a little bit much? I mean how does a ""almost a 1/2 second"" = ""throat raming"" or ""pummelling"" ? I would expect the Jaguar to be faster with a stick and the Benz with an auto. I have nothing against the X-Type, but that test is a little thick in my opinion.

One other thing: Who says the X-Type has the most rigid structure in this class? I've read that the C320 Sport, 330i and especially the A4 all have very stout structures. This has also been my experience in driving all three of them.

116,"September 22, 2002 2:29PM",riez,"jagboyxtype... Check out the February 2002 issue of Car and Driver. 7 car comparison. X-type 3.0 MANUAL came in 5th place. Woes included lack of overall performance, poor ride quality, poor brakes, and poor skidpad. X-type was tied for 2nd slowest 0-60 mph time (7.2 seconds), longest braking distance, 2nd worst skidpad result, but did have the 2nd best emergency-lane-change maneuver mph. C&D's X-type was pretty basic, with only a $39,170 MSRP.

Notice the trend, all the tested X-type's had stickers of $39,000 and up, and most publications harp that the Jag fails to deliver the goods for so many dollars.

Pushing $40,000 does NOT seem to be entry-level to me. The X-type 2.5 is more the entry-level Jaguar."
117,"September 22, 2002 6:56PM",dpvwia2,How about the fact that it look like a Ford Contour? Yikes...
118,"September 23, 2002 3:52AM",jagboyxtype,"Merc1-

The X-TYPE's structure is 30% more rigid than the previous class leader, the BMW 3-Series. You may check out AutoWeek's review of the car for that information, as well as a review on the site autobytel.com and reviews conducted by Autocar including their ""Autocar Book"" all about the X-TYPE. I never said that any of those cars you mentioned didn't have very solid and rigid structures nor did I try to imply that, but at the moment, the Jaguar has the most rigid structure in its class.

Also, as riez would say, ""I did not write the article"". The reviewers were the ones who said all of those quotes about the X-TYPE beating the C-Class in every part of that test, and not just acceleration times. Take braking (""top drawer"" for the X-TYPE), or how they said the cars felt when being driven.
____________________________________

Riez-

I pity you, because you only believe what car magazines tell you, and you allow them to choose for you what is best instead of collecting your own information and actually checking things out for yourself. Listen to what you've been sayin: ""Car & Driver said this, and MotorTrend said this, and Road & Track said this"". Granted, I have used their quotes and stats many times to back my own opinions as well (which I even do here), but you've taken it to an extreme.

""Do you read MT or R&T?"" you ask me.
Sometimes I do, but only for entertainment purposes. Why? Because I do not trust them, do not believe everything they say, and only take what they have to say as their own human opinions. And I am not the only one who feels that way. ABC News, for instance, did an investigation on the subject of car magazines being biased and omitting facts to suit their own interests. They use the Ford Focus and Car&Driver and MotorTrend's opinions of the car as an example:

""For example, in January, Car and Driver listed the Ford Focus among its '10 Best Cars of the Year.' It never mentioned that Ford had recalled the Focus eight times for various problems when that review was written [one such recall was because the wheels would fall off of the car!]. Also, just this month, when Motor Trend's review came out — no mention of the recalls or the fact that the government has five ongoing safety-related investigations of the Focus. (It currently has six ongoing investigations, but only five that Motor Trend could have known of when it went to press.)""
http://www.abcnews.com

Hmmm. Six government safety investigations, eight major recalls in its few years of production, and the Focus is a favorite among car magazines like Car&Driver and MotorTrend. Well, they can have it, and I'm sure you think it's a wonderful little car since everything they say suddenly becomes law for you.

ABC also mentions how certain car manufacturers that give all-expense paid trips to reviewers get higher scores and better reviews when the reviewers handle their cars. Even an auto reviewer interviewed in the article said ""there are other subtle ways that automakers try to woo the press"". MotorTrend's own C. Van Tune admitted to utilizing these perks from certain auto makers although his magazine has the resources to pay for these trips, etc. on its own.

The warning at the end of the article reads: ""So far, the big magazines don't seem to have changed their policies. So, be aware: When you read and see reviews of this year's models, some of those reviews were written by reporters who've been fed and fueled by the car companies.""

It can be expected that comparison tests would be especially succeptible to the effects of biases and perks from some automakers. This is why you cannot believe and trust car magazines for anything more than entertainment and a very few facts.

""Have you even taken the time to read what European Car has written? Or what MT and C&D have previously written?"" you also ask me. Yes, I have. European Car's own review of the X-TYPE is nothing short of pure flattery towards the car. Road&Track's review of the X-TYPE is also very complementary. Car&Driver tested the X-TYPE's 0 - 60 time as just 6.3 seconds and raved about ""enthusiast goods"" of the car. MotorTrend enjoyed the car very much, and bought their own long-term tester, of which they say ""This new X is one shaggy Jaggy"" and ""I'm anxious to try out the upcoming R version of the X-TYPE, because this is a very good sport sedan"". AutoWeek liked the car and decided that ""X"" was definitely an addition to the ""A"", ""C"", and ""3"" in the sport sedan equation. Forbes wrote a very fine review of the car. A vast majority of other reviews, such as those at carpoint and autobytel are also complementary to the X-TYPE. And again, Autocar was so inspired that they created a minibook about the ""Most Important Jaguar Ever"" and said that between it and a 330i, they don't know which one they would choose - ""it's that close"".

You mention ""American"" tests in your posts. I must also ask you, however, why you believe that any reviews or comparison tests about the X-TYPE from any other parts of the world are suddenly invalid? They are all reviews, how come only the ones you choose count? There are people from all over the world here at Edmunds, are their views and opinions also invalid to you because they do not live in the same country as you do?

On the matter of that Road&Track 11 car comparison, the reviewers say:
""So how, you ask, did a car as nice as the Jaguar X-TYPE end up second to last in this great big comparison test? That's easy: Price.""
Notice that they happened to also have loaded their X-TYPE with every option available on the car including such expensive items as the navigation system, weather package, and premium sound system, etc. Yet, other cars in their test were not fully loaded as the Jaguar was. The BMW, for instance, was lacking its navigation system and other items, the Mercedes-Benz (the second most expensive car in the group at $44,949) also without its navigation system and lacking its premium sound system (and in fact left without a CD player that no one seems to complain about not having in this car for this price, where as the Jaguar can take heat for having just a single-disc indash unit when not equipped with the 6-disc changer). A test with price included is not valid unless all cars are optioned out with the same equipment. The X-TYPE had much more than any of the other cars in the test did. A better comparison for price would have been to compare base prices of the cars or prices of options, or get this: equip the cars similarly. Take note that both the Saab and the Mercedes-Benz have higher starting prices than the Jaguar, and that the Jag's starting price is about $1,500-$2,000 above most of the other cars in the test, and that it comes standard with wood and leather which costs about $1,500-$2,000 to equip on the other cars. AWD is also standard on the Jag, and extra-cost options on the cars that can have it equipped. La"
119,"September 23, 2002 3:54AM",jagboyxtype,"<continued>Later in that same R&T issue, they happen to have purchased, out of all those cars, a long-term X-TYPE.

Also, on price, let's not complain about the X-TYPE when Road&Track's $39,804 (and I count that as near $40,000, wouldn't you?) BMW 330i does not even come with power seats in another comparo (page 74 of their ""Road Test Annual 2002"").


So what else did R&T say about the X-TYPE in that 11 car test? How about ""Whether the chassis is redolent of Jaguar tradition or not, no one complained that it didn't work. It feels like a modern, well-balanced sports sedan with excellent highway ride and good balance in the corners. Every time we got into a long stretch of fast, curving mountain road, whoever was in the Jag inevitably got on the walkie-talkies we all carry and said, 'This thing is really good in the curves.' It's a confidence-inspiring car, with good grip, linear steering, and precise turn-in. The engine is not bad either...our test car's optional 3.0-litre 4-cam V-6 put out a respectable 231 bhp, keeping it in this fast company with no particular effort...Overall, the X-TYPE is a comfortable, pleasent and useful car with a well-developed chassis...It's a good all-rounder with, probably just as much British charm as most modern drivers really want. Independent of price, it scored in about the middle of our group in performance and subjective ratings."" As a side note, they also say, ""The Jag's interior is a rich assemblage of shapes and textures, done up with nice details like the silver-rimmed green-faced gauges. Given its soft ride, the X-TYPE delivered surprisingly good handling"". http://www.roadandtrack.com


And most of its other reviews have said pretty much the same things about the car as stated above: good handling, nice styling, comfortable interior. Yeah, there are some bad reviews, but there are many many more good ones, and it doesnt't get ""panned"" as you have continually been repeating.


Let's also not overlook the TOP GEAR 2002 Motoring Survey, in which ""over 37,000 motorists"" were spoken to about 120 car models and 33 manufacturers. The rankings for the entry-level cars were:

1.) Lexus IS 200

2.) Jaguar X-TYPE

3.) BMW 3-Series

4.) Mercedes-Benz C-Class

5.) Audi A4 and A4 Avant (wagon)

6.) Saab 9-3

7.) Volvo S40 and V40 (wagon)

8.) Alfa Romeo 156


They had little quotes by some of the cars. The X-TYPE's read: ""Just past its first anniversary and the X-Type enters the survey three places ahead of the BMW 3-Series [out of the total 120 cars]. Great dealer service, few problems and good dynamics see to that.""


Let's not argue here though riez. We both have opinions, and I simply don't agree with yours. Hostilities aside, have a great day! :-)

The whole Jaguar/Ford thing died a long time ago. X-TYPE shares 6 points on its platform with the Mondeo - not even its entire platform, and it shares no body panels with any other car. Anyone could just as easily say that your A4 is just a Jetta with four rings on its grille.

120,"September 23, 2002 4:03AM",kdshapiro,"The X-TYPE's structure is 30% more rigid than the previous class leader, the BMW 3-Series.

I think the Xtype still has a way to go as far as I go, before I ever would consider one to be a class leader.

While you have a private debate going with riez - my two cents you buy what you buy for the reasons you buy, but the trades and mags of barometers. You have to read them, understand where they intersect with your beliefs and opinions and take it from there.

In addition, a $40K 330i is almost loaded and a base 330i can be had for $32K at ED plus air-fare."
121,"September 23, 2002 4:55AM",jagboyxtype,"Here, I built a fully-loaded RWD 330i:

___________________________
MSRP fully loaded: $45,235

This was done at the BMW U.S. website. It's a little higher than that $40K estimate of yours. My point is not to single out the 3 for high pricing, but to demonstrate that while a nicely equipped one can be had for around $40,000, like any other car in its class, it carries a high price when totally fully loaded. This is my point about the X-TYPE in the 11 car R&T comparison: a nicely equipped one (similarly equipped with that $40,000 3 in the test) can be had for around $40,000, but the editors instead chose to get a totally fully loaded one and then mark it down for a high price. It wasn't quite fair. Totally fully loaded, the Mercedes-Benz would have been the most expensive car in the test by quite a margin. Ever notice how the E-Class starts at around $50,000, but the S-TYPE and 5-Series start at around $42,000?

As far as class leaders go, I believe that all of the cars in this class are very good, and that they target slightly different groups. X-TYPE and C-Class have more luxury than the others, G35 and 3-Series are a little more performance oriented, but all of them share many traits with slight variances in the degrees of those traits.

It's nice to hear from you! We haven't talked for a while. Happy driving!"
122,"September 23, 2002 6:40AM",riez,"jagboyxtype... I merely pointed out how when the American automotive press has had a chance to test the X-type up against its main competitors, it falls flat. Pretty much every single American comparison test.

Why do I bring up American tests? Because I cannot buy a Euro-spec X-type in America. And many of the European cars a Euro-spec X-type is compared against in these tests aren't even sold in America. Besides marques like Fiat, SEAT, Alfa, Lancia, etc. Heck I can't even spell the French marques that are no longer sold in USA: Renault and Peugueot. Been so long since since I've even seen an old French-marque car in my neighborhood.

So ensuring all the cars are USA-spec is critical to a legitimate comparison.

And I've always loved the pro-Brit bias in the English car magazines. They do whatever they can to say nice things about English cars. I leaf thru their mags at my local Borders and Barnes & Noble. The German press has raved about the underlying Ford Mondeo platform. Mondeo built in Germany."
123,"September 23, 2002 8:41AM",merc1,"I've been subscribing to AutoWeek for over 10 years and I don't recall that issue. If you know what issue that is in due tell. I have hard time believe they did a specific testing of each of these cars structures to determine that. The A4 is the one I felt was the most solid. As far as that test goes, I think it was basically set up to show up any weakness the C320 may have.I don't think a 1/2 second is stomping anything into the ground, and the Jag should have been faster considering it was a manual. Beating the C-Class at acceleration and braking is not really that hard since that isn't what the car focuses on primarily. I'd be more impressed with a ""pumeling"" by the X-Type of the 330i or IS300 in those areas.

Don't get me wrong, I don't think the X-Type is a bad car, but that test had more than a twinge of bs to it.

124,"September 23, 2002 9:47AM",kdshapiro,"I don't know what car you speced out but it's not my car. I don't deem a Nav system a must on a fully loaded car. I am talking about leather, sport and most high end options. My 330i does not have sport, nav or xenon, but if I did it again, I might have gotten sport. To me it's fully loaded because there is nothing else I wanted and I belive the Navs are the biggest waste of money anyway. If you want to split hairs and say fully loaded is every available option, that's your call.

People have different requirments for what they want in a car. We have to be careful between comparing the MSRP of fully optioned cars, because most people do not order them that way. The base 330i with leatherette can be had at ED for a mere $32,000.

BTW..Nice to to talk to you as well."

They say, ""This particular parts-sharing, it turns out, only gives the Jag its chassis 'hard points' and its engine blocks, but not much else. Jaguarites say the chassis itself shares only six small panels with its blue-oval counterpart, and that their version has been reinforced significantly for stiffness and quiet. In fact, they boast, by the time the leaper hood ornament goes on the car, its static rigidity is 30 percent better than that of the nearest luxury segment competitor. By another measure, body stiffness comes in at 22 kg/degree vs. the 21 kg/degree recorded by the BMW 3 Series, a mighty fine measuring stick to use."" <--See, they measured it.</b>

Other reviews have noted that it has the most rigid structure in its class, I can find them and post their URLs if you'd like, if this review is not proof enough.

Also, if the link doesn't work because the site is a sign-in type, go to autoweek.com and use their search box, typing in ""Jaguar X-type"".

BTW: I do think that X-TYPE v. C-Class review was also a little ""BS""-ed, however, I believe all comparison reviews are either a little biased or include some BS, as you can read about in my long posts a few messages away. However...

You say ""Beating the C-Class at acceleration and braking is not really that hard since that isn't what the car focuses on primarily.""

Isn't the C-Class supposed to compete with the IS300, 330i, and X-TYPE? Why is it that when the X-TYPE does win, excuses can be made for the other car(s), with ""they don't focus on those areas""? I'm willing to invalidate the transmissions in the this test as they were not totally evenly matched there, but the X-TYPE won out every other category of the test as well: Engine, brakes, ride... I could just as easily say that the X-TYPE doesn't focus on those areas either, but no one would back me and it really is a poor excuse. You also note that 1/2 second is not ""stomping anything to the ground"", yet in the Road&Track 11-car test, the X-TYPE was just 0.6 second slower than the fastest car in the test, and it was marked down for that. We can't suddenly make an exception for this test. I could say that the X-TYPE doesn't focus on acceleration in the R&T review, but again that is a poor excuse. If we choose to accept the R&T 11 car test, then we must, by principle, accept this test as well. In those regards, the X-TYPE v. C-Class comparison was quite valid.

Take care!

Riez-

I think I'll terminate this discourse now that we have both had our say. It's just going to continue in a perpetual loop if we don't stop. But...

I noticed that you still say the car falls flat, and in all of those comparisons, you have said yourself that price was a major factor in the car's losing points, as well as R&T, C&D, and others noting that. I'm just wondering if you read my really long message a ways back, as I outlined how the X-TYPE in all of those tests was outfitted much more heavily with options than any of the other cars and that its price would have been closer to the others had the X-TYPE been outfitted with the same options as the others in the test. Also, as merc1 notes, 1/2 second differences, etc. are not large gaps. Being 0.6 second off from the fastest car in the test, and 0.5 from the winning car is not ""falling flat"" by any means.

You seem to fail to notice actual measurements and what the reviewers write about the cars, and instead only look at points and scores. Take note of the ""luggage space"" scores for the cars in the R&T 11 car test, for instance. The X-TYPE has a boot capacity of 16.0 cubic feet. For that, it received 7.8 out of 10 possible points in that category. Now look at the Cadillac CTS with a boot capacity of 12.8 cubic feet. Yet it received 8.4 points out of the 10, and it had a smaller boot. The Infiniti G35 has 14.8 cubic feet of boot space, yet even with less space than the X-TYPE, it received the same score of 7.8 out of 10. The 330i, with only 10.7 cubic feet of boot space received 7.6 points, only 0.2 less point than the X-TYPE with 5.3 more cubic feet than the 330i. These ratios aren't right, and I cannot help but feel that their other points and scores must also be affected by these kinds of discrepancies.

I also still disagree with you about European or other comparison tests not being valid. Included in these tests are cars such as the X-TYPE, C-Class, and A4, et al, that are sold in the U.S., as well as cars that are not available here. Just because a car is not U.S.-spec doesn't mean the test is totally invalid. In those other countries especially, those tests are very valid (as far as comparison tests go). It is not a question of whether or not the test is valid just to you, rather, it is a matter of how valid the test is as a fair test. That's where the problem is, you are choosing which tests you want to acknowledge and which you simply feel like leaving out. Besides, the difference between a U.S.-spec car and a non-U.S.-spec car is not going to come out in the test unless the car is crash tested or has an engine choice unavailable in the U.S., etc. You can get a general idea still, and to simply say that because it is not a test conducted by an American magazine is a bit ignorant. Especially as all of these cars are global cars.

You also claim that English reviews have a bias towards British cars and that the Germans also are biased. However, I have found that those two groups especially are very picky about cars and will tear a car apart worse than any American reviewer would dare to. The British also have a thing for BMW's - a German car - and I've not found a review where they had a bias for Jaguar or any other British car, and if they were biased and I missed it, they certainly could not be any more biased than any American editors.

Perhaps you have not noticed the bias that American reviewers have for German and Japanese cars? I believe Edmunds stated something about their ""infatuation"" with ""everything German"" in a Mercedes review, and the idea that Japanese cars are so much more reliable than any other cars is also overplayed to the point of now being a bias of American writers (and don't attempt to say that I'm saying that Japanese cars are not reliable now, because they are, I'm simply pointing out that there is an American bias of believing that they are tremendously more reliable than any other kind of car)."

You said ""I don't know what car you speced out but it's not my car. I don't deem a Nav system a must on a fully loaded car. I am talking about leather, sport and most high end options. My 330i does not have sport, nav or xenon, but if I did it again, I might have gotten sport. To me it's fully loaded because there is nothing else I wanted and I belive the Navs are the biggest waste of money anyway. If you want to split hairs and say fully loaded is every available option, that's your call.""

That's exactly what I was trying to prove about the X-TYPE in its tests. Take, for instance, the Road&Track 11 car comparo. The X-TYPE had every option available including the unnecessary navigation system and other equipment that the majority of other cars did not have. It has been that way in almost every comparison test: the editors choose a fully loaded (as in every single available option) X-TYPE and then mark the car down for being expensive in comparison to competitors that are not fully loaded.

You are totally correct, NO ONE ever totally and fully loads out their car with every available option, but the reviewers all do for the X-TYPE in its comparison tests. They don't for the other cars. Even that second-most-expensive-car in the test C320 Sport was still not fully loaded, it didn't even have a CD player, as I mentioned before in my other message. In the magazines, they depict the X-TYPE as costing $46,000 all of the time. A base X-TYPE 2.5 with standard Connoly leather, wood trim, and manual transmission can be had at $29,000. Make the car a 3.0 litre model, and you get everything in the base model plus standard indash CD player and other goodies, and your choice of manual or automatic transmission at no extra cost, for $35,000. Nicely equipped, a 2.5 is usually around $33,000. A nicely equipped 3.0 is around $38,000.

In my other message, I wasn't trying to talk about your car. I was using the 3-Series as an example of how in the tests they'll get a nicely equipped one at $39,000 - $40,000, but that the car's fully loaded price is $45,000, just as they only showed the X-TYPE's fully loaded price of about $46,000, when one that is nicely equipped is between $38,000 - $40,000 just like the other cars."
129,"September 24, 2002 10:28AM",kdshapiro,Okay I missed the point that particular car left nothing out in the options category. Most people do not buy a car like that.
130,"September 24, 2002 12:35PM",riez,"jagboyxtype... Maybe we'll have something to discourse about when Ford improves the future Mondeo X-type such that it can actually be competitive against cars in its class. As it stands, it just doesn't compete well as a serious all around sport sedan. Sure it has a big trunk, but it also has a cramped back seat. But I don't buy a serious all around sport sedan based on interior or trunk space. And sometimes a big trunk is offset by an odd shape and space-intruding hinges that limit useability over a smaller trunk that is nicely shaped with multi-link hinges. (Oops, think I meant to say when Jag improves the future X-type. )

And I'll really, really start worrying about and paying attention to European magazine results when Euro-spec cars are sold here. But today I can NOT even buy them. Think you should keep in mind that they often have many differences with their American counterparts (e.g., safety equipment, engines--they love diesels, transmissions) and there are tons of marques in Europe that are absent in America (Alfa, Fiat, Lancia, SEAT, Renault, Peugeout, Skoda, etc.)"
131,"September 24, 2002 5:58PM",jagboyxtype,"Riez-

You missed the target again. The trunk space example was simply an example of how the points awarded to certain aspects of the cars in the tests do not tell the whole truth, as you misguidedly seem to believe. The fact of the matter is that the X-TYPE had more boot space than the other cars I mentioned, and it recieved less points than they did and in an unbalanced ratio, and that other scoring categories were similarly affected. You also failed to notice the phrases ""For example"" and ""For instance"" leading into what I was saying in many cases if you believe that boot space was all that I was speaking about.

You said of the X-TYPE's large boot ""And sometimes a big trunk is offset by an odd shape and space-intruding hinges that limit useability over a smaller trunk that is nicely shaped with multi-link hinges.""

From this I can tell that you never actually take the time to examine a car for yourself before passing judgement on it, but instead rely completely upon little comparison test articles and your own assumptions, as the X-TYPE does have multi-link boot hinges as opposed to the swan-neck hinges on such cars as the XJ8 and ES300, ect. that you assumed it had, and then stated it had as if it were a fact. But what can I expect from someone who finds himself clever at falsely mistaking a car for one with which it shares a few parts that cannot even be seen?

And on that topic, in the global car world of today, every car shares parts with another or many others. *FOR EXAMPLE* (<--if you miss it this time, I don't know what to do), BMW uses General Motors-sourced automatic transmissions and parts are shared with Mini. Volkswagen and Audi, Seat, Skoda, Porsche, Bentley, Lamborghini, and Bugatti all share many <i>many parts. DaimlerChrysler and Mercedes-Benz share some parts now too, as well as sharing parts with Hyundai and Mitsubishi. Making fun of that seems, well, kind of pathetic - unless you have a weird sense of humor. They share parts; yeah - so what? It's not really relevant.

And as I noted about reviews and comparisons from other countries, the cars do have some differences from U.S.-spec cars (as you and I had noted that engines can be different, etc.) but a general idea of the car can be had from those tests - as I had also said before in my other message. Quite often, those tests even use the versions of the cars equipped with engines that are sold with them in the U.S., as we generally have the larger versions of the engines available to us. If it's a diesel-engine test, they usually also have the whole test based upon that fact and will call it a ""Diesel Showdown!"" or something else to that same effect. Again (for now the second time), you cannot simply invalidate a test because it was not conducted in America. The cars we are disputing are not even built in America. And many times, the versions of the cars used in the tests are for the most part equivalent to their U.S.-spec versions. Alpha Romeos, Fiats, Renaults, and Vauxhalls are not sold in America, and thus I understand saying that for use in America, their tests would be for the most part inconcequential; but Audis, Jaguars, BMWs, and Mercedes are all sold in the U.S. as well as foreign countries, and those foreign versions of the cars have little difference from their U.S.-spec versions as far as any test categories can gauge. They never crash-test the cars in these comparisons, and as C. Van Tune pointed out in the ABC article about how reviewers are ""fed and fueled"" by certain car manufacturers, safety isn't an exciting enough category for these tests, so to those reviewers who write about them, it is irrelevant. Safety equipment is usually the primary difference between U.S.-spec and foreign versions of the same cars, but that's not going to show-up in one of these car comparisons because they are not comprehensive enough at all to measure such things. Yet it's not just foreign articles that you are saying are invalid, though. You are just choosing the ones that back your arguement to the slightest degree, which again just a display of your ignorance.

As well as the boot-hinge thing that you got wrong (remember, X-TYPE has the multi-link hinges with auto-opening gas struts, not swan-neck hinges), you also said that it had a cramped rear seat in comparison to its competators. In comparison to a long-wheelbase Maybach, it is cramped, yes. However, it has one of the larger rear seats in its class. Not only is it larger than the BMW 3-Series' rear seat as well as the IS300's and A4's, but it is also larger than the midsize 5-Series' rear seat (but I'll admit not by that much compared to the 5). In posts in other sections of the Town Hall, you defend how large the 5-Series' rear seat is and how comfortable it is for adult passengers as far as roominess goes, why do you call the X-TYPE's rear seat - which is even larger than the 5's - ""cramped"". Is this yet ANOTHER ASSUMPTION that you made about the X-TYPE?

By now I am sure that you have noticed that I have continually refered to things in this message that I have already spoken about in my other two posts addressed to you a few messages back. I'm wondering if you really even read them since your arguements are always the same, and now you're even making outright assumptions. No matter what I say and no matter how many facts I back my statements with, you seem to have your eyes closed to them and don't even take them into account. Not only that, but your statements are generally incorrect and your assumptions don't even touch on facts or reality.

And I'd say the best selling Jaguar in history is competative when it makes up 56.7% of Jaguar's U.S. sales and holds an astonishing 66% of the entry-level to mid luxury segment in Europe, as well as over 70% of Jaguar's sales in its third largest market, Italy. Was your statement about being competative just another assumption on your part?

Maybe we'll actually have a discussion when you start taking note of what's actually going on with the car and stop making assumptions and false remarks. Good day."
132,"September 24, 2002 11:27PM",merc1,"Ok, I read all that. So I'm supposed to believe Jaguar's claim over what every other brand claims right? Until I see an independent test of all of the cars in this class structural rigidity, I'll go by what feels the most solid, and it isn't the Jaguar X-Type. So we disagree there.
Secondly, everyone knows full well that the C-Class is not on the same plane with the 330i and IS300 when it comes to being ""sporty"". To impress me you'd have to beat those cars at all the track tests. Beating a C320 at the track isn't hard, the IS300 and 330i rule there. That acceleration test will never count in my book because of the trans difference.

I'm not saying the comparison as a whole was not valid, but I still maintain that they picked the areas in which the X-Type would winout. And Lastly the X-Type has been ranked below the C in every OTHER comparo done. If it were such a slaughter I'd think it would win some test over here too.

133,"September 25, 2002 5:40AM",riez,"jagboyxtype... You should have more carefully read my post. Did I specifically mention the X-type trunk (boot)? No, I was discussing trunks in general.

Do you harp on such little things regarding the X-type becasue it does so poorly in the performance realm when tested against its competitors? When you get creamed on the track and street, talk about the trunk?

I don't care about sales figures. What do they prove? If we used that we'd all be driving a Camry or Accord 4-cyl sedan!

As for Euro-land market, keep in mind two huge facts. Currently about 40 percent of the cars sold there are diesels. The ""hottest"" BMW is the 330id. Can I buy that in USA? NO! And that over 80 percent of the cars sold there are manual transmission. How many manual transmission diesel sedans, coupes, convertibles, etc. are sold in USA? Be willing to bet the figure is about zero. Ford Europe and Jag are rushing to get diesels into their Euro-products."
134,"September 25, 2002 7:24PM",jagboyxtype,"Riez-

Again my point was that the boot space example was an example of how the points awarded in such comparison tests do not give real data. Points and scores are skewed - or whatever adjective you would use to describe awarding more space with less points in a category that is all about having more space.

""And did you notice how I was careful to say that neither trunk space nor rear-seat space should have much, if any bearing, when it comes to comparing serious all around sport sedans?""

Yes, I did catch that phrase the first time I read it. However, your argument against the X-TYPE in you message before the last was that it had a cramped rear seat and had swan-neck boot-lid hinges - both statements that were false. And now your latest statement that you did not name the X-TYPE directly when speaking of such things as boot-space and rear-seat room really is a weak cover-up.

You stated: ""Maybe we'll have something to discourse about when Ford improves the future Mondeo X-type such that it can actually be competitive against cars in its class. As it stands, it just doesn't compete well as a serious all around sport sedan. Sure it has a big trunk, but it also has a cramped back seat. But I don't buy a serious all around sport sedan based on interior or trunk space. And sometimes a big trunk is offset by an odd shape and space-intruding hinges that limit usability over a smaller trunk that is nicely shaped with multilink hinges. (Oops, think I meant to say when Jag improves the future X-type.""

Your argument was that you do not consider rear-seat room or trunk space when it comes to sport-sedans because those are two areas in which the X-TYPE excels. If it had a small boot and a cramped back seat, then you would be attacking the car for those two points! Then, to further attempt to deride the X-TYPE, you state that large boots, such as the X-TYPE has, often have space-intruding swan-neck hinges and odd opening shapes. Of course you did not have to ""name"" the X-TYPE when making such statements - you implied it and did indeed name the car with the word, ""it"". Why even mention space-intruding hinges if the X-TYPE does not have them? Also, paragraphically, your topic was about the X-TYPE, and as those areas were spoken about there, they are directly linked to the X-TYPE. However, your arguments were wrong, and to counter my catching of them being wrong, you are now stating that you were not speaking of the X-TYPE - a weak argument.

""I don't care about sales figures. What do they prove?""

You constantly say that the X-TYPE does not compete well against its competators. Sales figures and how much of the car's manufacturer's sales the car makes are a direct indication of how well the car competes. If the car did not compete well, then it would in turn have low sales figures and most probably not make up much of its manufacturer's sales. The Camry and Accord 4-cylinder are not in the entry-level sport sedan class. However, in their own class, it is generally accepted that they are very good cars. Also, the ratio of new buyers of a new addition to an established market segment is an indication of how well the car competes, and over 90% of X-TYPE buyers are new customers to Jaguar. That means that it is taking sales from competators that compete in that market segment - thus it is competing very well.

If you have not gotten the fact that there are European comparison tests of cars that are sold here in slightly different forms but with the same engines as U.S.-spec versions, then it is just a show of your unwillingness to be reasonable to any degree. I have stated that those cars are not exact doubles of their U.S. versions, but the ones outfitted with gasoline engines that are available in the U.S. and other such options are so much like their American versions that a comparison test is not going to be able to differentiate the two. If there are differences measurable by the tests, then you can take them into account. However, to invalidate the entire test is ignorant and unreasonable.

""Do you harp on such little things regarding the X-type becasue it does so poorly in the performance realm when tested against its competitors?""

No, I ""harp"" on such little things because YOU bring them up by making FALSE assumptions which you present as if they were facts. Again, I used those ""little"" subjects as examples to prove my points because facts are a necessity in presenting the truth. YOU are the one who decided to ""harp"" on my examples.

Also, as I have stated and continue to have to remind you, the X-TYPE does not get beaten in the performance realm against competators. EXAMPLES: the X-TYPE completely won an all-out performance test against the competing model from Mercedes-Benz, the C320 Sport. It is a competing car. Then, your so-very-important Road&Track even states: ""In acceleration, the 3.0 X-TYPE is among the quickest. Accompanied by a nice-but-distance exhaust note, the Jag goes from 0-60 mph in 6.5 seconds, undercutting the boy-racer Lexus IS 300's and Audi A4's 7.1, Mercedes-Benz C320's 6.8 sec. and matching the BWM 330i's time. And remember the X-TYPE, like the Quattro, loses a tick off the line, because of a no-wheel spin launch with all-wheel-drive"". According to your precious magazines, it also out brakes the Porsche 911 GT2 from 80 mph and stops just 2 feet shorter than the 911 GT2 from 60 mph. That is real performance and if you try to argue that down, I believe I could safely say that it is a sign of a delusional mind.

Perhaps you should stop simply reading my posts, but should actually begin synthesising the data as well. I'm having a hard time responding to much of the outrageously false statements you've made thus far.

You did get one thing right though. Jaguar is getting diesel engines ready for the European market as they do make up for much of a manufacturer's sales there. That was a weak point for the X-TYPE: it had no diesels to compete against the 330d etc. with the high gasoline prices in Europe. Rest assured that when the engines are available, the X-TYPE will compete even better than it already does so well. And when I'm on the track, I'll remember to mention my car's boot to the Porsche that I out-brake and to the IS 300, A4, C320 that I out accelerate and the BMW driver that I'm dead-locked with. Even Road&Track took note of that."
135,"September 25, 2002 7:41PM",jagboyxtype,"Merc1-

Other marques are not claiming that they have more rigid structures than the X-TYPE has because they do not. You say that you'll go by what you feel feels more solid, however, I could just say that the X-TYPE feels more solid to me and say that the discussion is over. Either way, we cannot do that. AutoWeek had the measurements for structure rigidity in their article, and I even quoted them a little way back. They also noted that the X-TYPE's structure is 30% more rigid than the previous class leader's. That means that the previous class leader no longer has the class-leading structure in rigidity because the X-TYPE, now the class leader in structural rigidity, beats it by 30%. You are just choosing not to accept a fact.

As for the X v. C article, you say that they chose to test in areas where the X-TYPE would win, but then wouldn't other car media groups just be choosing areas in which the 330i wins? The same can be said about any comparison. Look at what is said in these articles, point-wise, the C-Class may win, however, in actual measurements, the X-TYPE beats it. Take for instance what Road&Track said about acceleration, which I quoted above in my message to riez.

If the measurements of the A4's rigidity came out and proved to be higher than the X-TYPE's, then I would accept that, however, at this moment, the X-TYPE is known as the most rigid car in its class.

This is not to say that the A4 has not surpassed the 3-Series in rigidity or possibly the X-TYPE, or to say that the car or any of the cars in this class are lacking in structural rigidity; it is simply to say that with the information available, all current measurements have proven the X-TYPE to be the most rigid to this day.

This is the X-TYPE section of the car crash test above:


http://euroncap.com/details.php3?id=car_117_2002


Take note that this is the ""Jaguar X-Type 2.0 LHD"" marked under the ""Make, model and hand of drive"" portion of the chart at the bottom of the page. The X-TYPE 2.0 is the low-end Europe-only version of the car that lacks the extra driveshaft that the 2.5 and 3.0 litre models have that are sold globally (as well as the driveshaft that is found in the 3-Series and C-Class). Thus, its crash tests produce weaker results than the 2.5 and 3.0 versions, and 3-Series and C-Class, because 2.0 is a FWD car with no longitudal driveshaft that is found in AWD (X-TYPE) and RWD (C-Class, 3-Series) cars.


Check out this site:


http://www.hwysafety.org/vehicle_ratings/ce/html/0210.htm


It notes that the X-TYPE underwent structural changes after December 2001 but does not say if that was a version-specific change (which I discovered it was). A letter to Consumer Reports aided research, and their reply was as follows:


""We spoke with JNA (Jaguar North America) on this question and they explained that the Jaguar X-Type was originally introduced in Europe as a 2.0 litre FWD (Front Wheel Drive) model. The only models sold in the U.S. are 2.5 and 3.0 liter AWD versions.... that achieve better frontal crash test results than the FWD European model due to a prop shaft that runs the length of the car from front to rear. The prop to the rear supplies power to the rear wheels as well as the front, which accounts for the AWD traction... The modifications made and referred to in IIHS's report on X-Types (made) after December 2001 were actually modifications made to FWD European models and are not applicable to the U.S. AWD models.""

(Thanks ""JagDude"" and Consumer Reports for this information).


Also note that the reason why the C-Class recieved a 5-star rating in the European test over the 4-star rating that all of the others in this class recieved was because it was the only car that had a flashing light that lit-up a sign reading the equivalent of ""fasten your seatbelt"" on its dash, which is to become a standard feature in Europe in the future(?). It would have recieved that same 4-star rating had it not had the light. This is straight off the site:


""Extra points awarded for the way that the C-class reminds its passengers to buckle their seat belts have now made it the second car ever to gain a five-star crash protection rating. Results for the C-class were published last year and it achieved four stars. But Euro NCAP has since changed its scoring system to encourage car makers to fit seat-belt warnings.""


All in all, I'd feel very safe in any one of the cars in this class, and I do feel safe being in one of them. Stay safe everyone."
148,"September 29, 2002 10:58AM",linard,"I honestly cannot remember a car I've been in that HASN'T had a seatbelt warning light. Our 87 Mercedes 420 SEL had it and my 99 Honda Prelude has it. Maybe this is due to European influence as the Focus (originally introduced and designed in Europe) has an obnoxious system that beeps and chimes if the driver does not fasten within an allotted amount of time and other cars I've been in have ""sensed"" the weight of a passenger and have flashed the seatbelt light as well (I believe the LandCruiser does this). However, as the seatbelt usage stats are dropping in the US, maybe this is a good idea after all. I can personally attest my safety and my mother's life to seatbelts.

BTW JagBoy, the EuroNCAP X-Type was a 2002 and it stated that the FWD 2.0 was released March of that year which is supported by both CAR and Top Gear Magazines (British publications). In addition, I am relatively certain that the X-Type was introduced as an AWD model to differentiate it from the Mondeo and to keep it from alienating Jag owners who may have cringed at the thought of a FWD Jag (this is from a CAR article soon before the X-Type itself was introduced in May of 2001). However, as the base 2.5 is an already relatively expensive car and does not fare well against a C180 or 318i in terms of value, Jag decided to introduce the FWD 2.0 with a stick as standard.

From what I understand, the driveshaft does assist in distributing the crash impact rearward, however, the larger engine block of the 3.0 tends to push rearward earlier in an accident than the smaller block of the 2.0 with it's fewer driveline components (obviously as it is FWD) so the crumple zones of the 2.0 have more room to crumple. I believe this is the reason why Mercedes decided to replace the 3.2 inline 6 of the E class with the smaller block of the 3.2 V6 in 99 and the difference in crash test scores between a 97 and a 00 are pretty significant although I'm not sure if Mercedes conducted any significant changes to the structure since they lowered the hood by an inch."
149,"September 29, 2002 7:49PM",wishnhigh1,"""they DOUBLE their rigidity with EVERY platform update... since it's you telling me, i believe you, but that kinda boggles the mind... one would think there's a point where you can't go beyond?""

Well...yes theoretically speaking, there is a point where you cant go beyond...but nothin on the face of this earth that has a perfect structural rigidity.

We are talking about a large structure, on the scale of 100s of centimeters, which carries payloads of about 1000 pounds, and is subject to stresses incurred by hard braking and acceleration and cornering. Not to mention the constraints that mass production places on structural rigidity.

There is still a lot of flex in even the most rigid of automobiles. Even full out race cars have problems from structural rigidity...I believe the initial Audi R8 had multiple problems with body flex...parts of the body would pinch and snap hoses and electrical lines.

So, yes, there is tons of room for improvement in all cars in the area of rigidity."
150,"September 30, 2002 9:28PM",jagboyxtype,"Yes, my X-TYPE also has a seatbelt warning light in the dash. Most all cars do. In addition, it chimes at you when you do not have your seatbelt on, and it has sensors in the seats that measure how much the occupant of the seat weighs and more sensors determine how far the occupants are from the dash and steering wheel so that it can calculate how much force to use when firing airbags in the event of a collision. A small amber light in the corner of the wood veneer on the passenger's side lights up and displays whether the occupant there weighs enough for the airbag to be automatically turned on or off, and the seats automatically also turn off the airbags if a baby or childseat is detected.

The warning system in the Mercedes C-Class in that test was a different light from the ones we have in our cars here. Notice that the C-Class had scored a 4-star rating in the test just as all of the other cars in that class did, but because of the addition of another light that said ""put on your seatbelt"", the car's score was later changed to a 5 to promote more lights that say ""put on your seatbelt"" to be used in other cars. I'm not saying that the C does not deserve a high rating in crash tests, but its additional star over the other cars in its class is simply because it has an additional light that tells passengers to wear their seatbelts on top of the light on the dash that says to wear your seatbelt. It is not necessarily safer than the other cars because of that light, and so I do not believe that it should have gotten an entire extra star for a light.


You are also wrong about the 3.0 Jaguar engine ""pushing"" into the cabin in a crash before the 2.5 and 2.0 because they are the same engine blocks but the 3.0 has been drilled-out more to be larger. Also, the engines do not enter the cabins at any time in a crash because the X-TYPE is designed to ""drop"" its engine when it is in a severe frontal crash. Most modern cars do this. X-TYPE's engines are also mounted horizonatally, so they are not taking up a terrible amount of longitudal space in the engine bay, thus the chances of them penetrating the passenger cabin is slim in comparison to longitudally oriented engines. Again, however, the X-TYPE drops its engine when it has a severe frontal crash, so it never enters the passenger compartment no matter what engine size is used. The argument that a 2.0 FWD X-TYPE would be safer than an AWD larger displacement version is null and void, because the engine does not enter the cabin at any time during any impact.


You really should read the bottom chart of the EuroNCAP page for the X-TYPE:


http://euroncap.com/details.php3?id=car_117_2002


It specifically states that the car is: ""Jaguar X-Type 2.0 LHD. Only the FWD X-TYPE is built with the 2.0-litre engine, which again is the same engine block as the 2.5 and 3.0, but not drilled-out as much. All other X-TYPEs are built in AWD configuration. The AWD driveshaft of the AWD X-TYPEs aid in collisions v. the FWD version that is sold alongside them in Europe against 318 and C180.


Mercedes-Benz decided to changed to a V6 from an I6 because they lowered the bonnet of the E-Class between those configurations and could not fit the I-6 under the lowered bonnet, as well as because it may have cost less to produce and it could be used in more vahicles as it had better packaging. That is also the reason for the discontinuation of the E300 diesel, as the diesel engine could not fit under the lowered bonnet that was used when the V6 was introduced (that and because the E300 did not sell well here). The E-Class should have been designed to drop its engine in a crash as well. I've not heard of a modern car being designed so that its engine penetrates the passenger compartment in a collision."
151,"October 1, 2002 4:37PM",linard,"While the C-Class did gain an extra star because NCAP changed it's guidelines earlier this year on performance in crashes and safety features provided, the C class did earn it's full 5 stars as it's a very well designed car collision-wise, when I can find the article in which NCAP justified giving the C class an extra star b/c of it's overall performance, I'll paste the link. As the pre 2003 E Class also includes this seatbelt light, your logic would conclude that it too, should receive 5 stars from it's previous 4 when it doesn't.

The fact that car engines are not designed to go into the passenger compartment is obvious, what isn't as obvious is while the X-Type is designed to, as you describe, drop it's engine and driveline components, they will always ""push"" into the compartment as evidenced by the Insurance Institute's listing of the crash details in which the X-Type exhibited moderate footwell intrusion, between 8 to 12 cm. The best rated C Class, on the other hand, had intrusion measures of 2 to 3 cm. Engineers are constantly trying to limit this phenomenon. While I don't doubt the driveshaft aids in crash test scores, I wasn't trying to prove one way or another, I was speculating on a possible alternative.

And while I may be wrong on the engine block of the 2.0 being different from the 2.5 and the 3.0, I am certain that the E class' hood and front fender structures were lowered as a result of the new engine's newfound underhood space, and not due to the new engines being introduced b/c of the lowered hoodline. This is evidenced by the 99 E320 having the V6 with the prefacelifted hoodline. The discontinuation of the E300 in the U.Ss WAS caused by the low demand for that particular car AND b/c of the structural change. However, that never meant that Mercedes dropped diesels from it's complete linup, in fact, Europe still has the option of a few remarkable diesel E class engines which Mercedes could have introduced here along with the redesigned 2000 E Class."

154,"October 2, 2002 12:33AM",wishnhigh1,"I have seen 3 Mercedes cars in accidents where the cars were totalled, two of which were rollover accidents.

One of the rollover accidents was an S430, and it had a mild cabin protrusion, but nothing serious. The cabin was in perfect shape basically. The other was I believe a 600SEL. This one was extremely important because even though this car had pillarless windows, the roof of the car did not cave in at all, even though the car came to a rest upside down. The guy was still in the car at the time, and he was hanging upside down, with no visual bruises, and a few minor cuts from broken glass.

The third accident was an E320 which was involved in a head on collision with a Camaro, who was racing another Camaro on a 2 lane road. I didnt see the drivers, but I saw the car as it was being towed away, and again, no cabin protrusion at all. The car was completely destroyed up to the point where the footwell started.

Im generally dont praise late model Mercedes', but I will always say glamorous things about them when it comes to safety. In my opinion, they are a few steps above volvo. They also have some of the strongest roof structures short of a 3"" thick roll bar."
155,"October 2, 2002 3:38AM",sphinx99,"I'll say it up front, I don't think Edmunds does a consistent job on sedan reviews. I understand the whole ""they're in BMW's payroll"" thing as well as the ""but we're not"" thing. This month's letters to the editors & Edmunds' responses make good points on both sides.

Unfortunately, Edmunds does a fabulous job of putting numbers to their words that later can be dug up and compared. I'm specifically looking at the entry level luxury sedan comparos - 2001 where a TL-S edged out a 330i, then 2002 where a 330i wiped the floor with the competition. The idea (and some will agree while others disagree) is that the scores tended to deliberately put BMW above the Acura.

Is this happening? Well, I decided to look at the numbers behind the comparisons to find out. Given identical cars, whereas the two were eventually matched on performance in 2001, now there is a 20 point spread between them in 2002. What, Acura got slower or BMW got faster? Given identical front seat comfort in 2001, now for 2002 BMW front seat comfort is tops while Acura's is bottom. Did the seats actually change, or did the editors of the 2002 review have smaller rumps?

Not that only Acura gets the shaft either. In 2001 BMW got a higher ""feature content"" rating than the TL-S. In 2002, a 330i with MORE features than the 2001 model only tied the feature content rating than a TL-S with the same features. This in spite of the fact that features the 330i lacked in 2001 (dual zone climate control, indash CD changer) were simply left off the Top 10 features list in 2002, leaving BMW as a vehicle that offers every Top 10 feature as either standard or optional.

Basically, I like the prose of the articles and take away many good things from reading them. When I look at the rankings, though, they seem to be statistically invalid; if, twelve months later, your opinions on identical seats can change that much, then how can you rank these cars based on 1% differences in the final rankings?

In one of the comparos, it was stated that the margin for error was about 0.5%, and any two cars tallying numbers within .5% of each other would be considered tied. I suggest increasing that buffer to 10% in order to account for the startling differences you find between two cars after just one year.

Until then, I'm going to stop reading into the numbers and ranking, and concentrate on the prose and photographs. We spend a great deal of effort arguing here about which sedan came in #1 and which one came in #2. If you look at the numbers used to actually rank these vehicles against each other, they fluctuate so wildly from one set of editors to another (you'd think that using a set of editors would even out the fluctuation) so as to make the ranking of these vehicles practically worthless.

Front seat comfort
2001: Acura 83, BMW 83
2002: BMW 9.2, Acura 7.6

Rear seat comfort
2001: BMW 74 Acura 70
2002: Acura 9.2 BMW 5.8

Conclusion: either BMW and Acura received total redesigns in 2002 unbeknownst to all of us, or the editor butt-o-meter does not produce repeatable results."

About seat comfort, my theory is seats are mass produce by suppliers and sometimes maybe precision of making the seats can run off track. Who knows. Probably the reason they were not as comfortable in Acura in 2002 as was in 2001. Don't know how to go about that one.

159,"October 2, 2002 1:25PM",linard,"I can personally vouch for the excellent performance of Benzes in collisions, my mom had a gray market 1981 500 SL that was broadsided at a perfectly 90 degree angle to her car at 40 - 50 miles an hour.

The other car was totalled and although the side of the car was basically crushed in, the passenger compartment's space was maintained. In addition, the door would still open and close normally and she was able to, amazingly, drive it home. I remember how thick the doors on the ""Dallas"" era SL's were, amazing... Took 30,000 to fix it and even then, it was never the same. We also had a 1987 420 SEL that was rear ended by a Pontiac Bonneville at approx 25 mph and the Pontiac's front was pretty damaged to about the front wheels. Our Benz, on the other hand, suffered little more than scrapes along the length of the bumper, but no structural damage, the bumper wasn't even displaced at all.

161,"October 2, 2002 4:41PM",sphinx99,"""Just wanted to share with everyone that, after those things happen to you, brand loyalty takes on a whole new meaning...""

Of course, it goes both ways. Many years ago in my first ever car, a 1988 Ford Taurus that I loved to death, I was rear-ended while sitting at a red light by an almost brand new Mercedes E-class. He had some bumper damage and the front hood was a bit bent. In contrast, my Taurus was destroyed--I was slammed into a Buick in front of me, and half the engine bay and almost all of the trunk were completely collapsed. To the dearly departed Taurus's credit, there wasn't any cabin intrusion, and I only bruised my shins, but the car was totaled while the Benz probably picked up a thousand dollars worth of body work. I'll never forget the Mercedes dude getting out of his car and bending over to keenly examine his slightly crunched bumper while I stared at my utterly destroyed car.

On a more positive note, that was the last Ford I ever owned. Whew!

In conclusion: Mercedes sedans are notable not only for their defense, but for their offense as well. If I were looking to take out Dodge Neon drivers, literally, I'd pick a S500 as my instrument of mayhem. If you're looking to drive while combing your hair, talking on the cell phone and changing radio stations at the same time, but do not want to sit in a Ford Expedition, then an E-class may be for you!"

If you are considering the Cadillac CTS, you should also look at the Lincoln LS6. Lincoln dealers are really discounting these fine cars. Most CTS' I've seen at two local Cadillac dealers tend to be loaded up with $5-7K worth of options. Hard to find one near $30K.

If you want powerful car and don't mind FWD, you might consider Acura 3.2TL, Infiniti I35, Nissan Maxima SE, or Nissan Altima 3.5SE.

Jag S-type is not normally considered ""near luxury"". Thinking its base price starts in the low $40,000s and quickly moves up with options. If you can afford this, you might consider BMW 5 Series (525i or 530i) or Lexus GS300."

04CTS vs 03LS8 (best America has to offer)
03I35/Max vs O3TL-S (best FWD on a budget)
04TL vs 04 9-5 (best FWD)
04 S60R vs X-type 3.0 (not sure there's any real AWD competition under 40k)

Are you confusing the IS300 with the ES300/330? The ES is FWD V6 and based on the Camry platform. The IS300 is RWD I6 based on the Toyota Altezza. The IS can be had with manual and automatic transmissions. The IS300 also has a SportCross touring (station wagon) version."

I have no idea as to how well they lease... my max payment is 300 and then thers another 250 from parents on top of that but I'd rather not have a 450 - 500 $ lease payment but I don't know... any suggestions... ?any one know what a 5 series or even a base MB E class leases for? just wondering thank you all very much"
194,"September 28, 2003 12:12PM",riez,"cjs2002... You have me thoroughly confused. Are you in the under $40,000 range or not?

At post #198 you wrote, ""tryin to see if I can get a deal on a base [Jaguar] 3.0 S type and go from there."" The Jaguar S-type competes with Audi A6, BMW 5 Series, and MB E-class.

Then at post #205 you write, ""now as to the [Lexus] ES300 and [BMW] 330[i] I like but they are out of my price range."" How can these two cars, that are less expensive than a Jaguar S-type, be out of your price range?

If you can buy or lease a Jaguar S-type, you could certainly buy or lease an ES300 or 330i.

Then you also write, ""I have no idea as to how well they lease... my max payment is [$]300 and then there is another [$]250 from parents on top of that but I'd rather not have a [$]450 - 500$ lease payment but I don't know.""

What you can afford to lease is way different than what you can buy. You should check out the various lease deals. Jaguar X-type leases heavily subsidized. Seen some inexpensive rates with 3 Series."

The 1.8T is a nice car, but the weight tends to make it sluggish. It can be improved with aftermarket performance products (chip, exhaust, etc.), but would bring you up in price to the 3.0.

The A4 3.0 has one of the nicest interiors around. I also do mostly highway driving, and the interior combined with the performance handling makes this a pleasureable ride. In winter, the Quattro system really shines. I've been able to drive through some nasty snowstorms over the past 2 years, and I've always felt under control wherever I was going.

Audi also has a 4 year / 50,000 mile service program that covers all service at no cost to you. With that along with the 4 year / 50,000 mile warranty, all you'll spend is for gas and tires (if needed). With the 2004 models now appearing on the lots, you can make a good deal on any remaining 2003s.

According to many sources (dealers and Infiniti customer service), most of the G35 require rotor replacement in addition to costly brake job. Infiniti knows about the problem and IS NOT paying for the rotors. Be prepared to buy yourself a new set of rotors for every brake job. And you will need this quite often, to the delight of your local dealer. Unfortunately, I was one of the early victims and did not expect that the car will be so bug ridden as it is.

BMW 3 series - If I wanted the benchmark
Lexus IS300 - CR rates this cars drivetrain almost as good as the 3-series. And as riez points out is has LSD.
Infiniti G35 - Stripper version almost the least expensive of the bunch.
Lincoln LS - I would question the reliability of these.
Cadillac CTS - should be awesome with it's new engine.
Audi A4 - all around nice car.
Acura 3.2TL - for a sporty sedan this would be at the top of the list.

But to me the cars discussed here are all in class."
206,"October 13, 2003 3:34PM",riez,"Strongly believe the segmentation should be based on what is actually paid. Not on inflated MSRPs. This is really a sign of what the market thinks is the real value of the car.

Think the heart/meant of this segment is around $27,500-32,500. With the fringes at $25,000-27,500 and $32,500-35,000. A car with an MSRP of $40,000-$44,000 that actually sells for around $35,000 really is in this segment. Lincoln (LS), Cadillac (CTS), Infiniti (M45) and some others heavily discount their cars.

This would cover everything from Acura TSX, Nissan Maxima, Jag X-type 2.5, MB C230, and 300M (at the low end) and the 330i, 525i, Jag X-type 3.0 & C320 (at the high end) with a ton of cars in the middle. Leaves cars like CTS6, LS6, and IS300 in the middle.

Jag X-type a great example. Easy to see MSRPs of the 3.0 over $40,000. But Jag needs heavy subsidies and discounts to move. And for 2004, Jag lowered the base price of the 3.0 by a couple thousand dollars and added a couple thousand dollars of ""free"" standard equipment. The market spoke what this car was worth!"

209,"October 13, 2003 6:52PM",riez,"kdshapiro... I've always tried to base a purchase decision on what I can buy a particular car for and how much I think it will cost me to own. MSRP is an important consideration, more so for those marques that can charge at or near MSRP. But the reality of a specific purchase decision has to take into account the actual money that will change hands, both now and in the long haul.

Remember the old G35 vs 3 Series debate? I always mentioned BMW CCA discount for members, long-term resale value, value of free maintenance, etc. Others raised ED price. I also included CPO. When G35 first came out, there was a limited supply and it was hot to market (with dealers not moving much off MSRP, though that has certainly changed now) compared to the readily-available E46 3 Series (that came out as MY99). Just looking at MSRPs didn't do justice to the cost analysis.

Of course, since discounts may vary by region, time of year, etc., MSRP always has to be an initial starting point."
210,"October 14, 2003 4:53AM",qbrozen,"not only do discounts vary by region, time of year, etc, but they vary by buyer. Comparing what YOU could get 2 different cars for can be completely different than what I could get 2 different cars for. Just because your local BMW dealer gives you $10K off car X doesn't mean I could do the same or vice versa. So comparing what cars ""sell for"" is extremely difficult. The only way I've seen to do something like this fairly is to use an online buying service where the prices are available to the public (like carsdirect or similar) or to strictly use TMV here on edmunds."

To mod the G you can do a ton with the work the guys owning 350Z have done - since the underpinnings are the same as the G the G guys do what the Z guys innovate. Cold Air intake, Pulleys, light flywheel, grounding kit, intake plenum upgrade, cams are available, headers, catbacks and true duals are almost availble. ECU upgrades to raise redline and improve mods where the ECU retard them by defaukt are available as well.

PS a guy with exhaust intake and plenum upgrade with a ECU flash got a 14.1 in an auto sedan. I think you could get to 13.9 with all the above. NA baby

Some or many of these may add up to a couple grand but its fun for me over time to do most of these things. Much more mods I think the m3 was good for and plenty more to come. There are some serious enthusiast in G forums out there too. Check em out"

with the R you'd probably be up to around 340-350 hp with modest mods like that. With the G35 its tougher to say, but maybe you could get it up to 275-285 (if a chip is available) without getting into the big money mods.

Probably the biggest advantage of the R aside from AWD is the 4C suspension. I really don't know why anyone would say it doesn't feel as planted when all reviews I've read state that you would NOT want to use the Advanced setting on the R unless you were on a track.

220,"November 12, 2003 8:47AM",helena143,"Hi. I am trying to decide between the G35 and a BMW 330i, and wud appreciate any ideas on what else I shud try. (I've tried both cars plus the IS300 and the RX-8). I was almost sold on the G35 until I read about its brake and cd players problems. Plus people are not pleased with Infiniti's service.

I guess now I have no option, b/c the only comparable car to a G35 (BMW 330i w/ performance package--a must. Otherwise it's too slow.) is too much $$$. After receiving excellent service from both Honda and Saab, I have no interest in getting crap from any service dept./dealer. I mean, Saab gives you a loaner even if you are getting an oil change! And they just finished replacing the entire 200 watt Harmon Kardon sound system on my 9-5 because ONE speaker was fried (which was me playing the music too loud, not a defect). I definitely do not want to downgrade either in car quality (my 9-5 has been PERFECT) or service.

However, I just did some research on Lexis and and Infiniti is rated very high by JD Power and Associates.

For initial quality for the 2003 model year:

1. Lexus
2. Cadillac
3. Infiniti

8. BMW
11. Honda
14. Benz
29. Mazda
32. Saab

For dependability in 2003 (this rated vehicles of the 2000 model year after 3 years):

1. Lexus
2. Infiniti

13. BMW
12. Saab
26. Benz

For 1998 models after 4 years:

1. Lexus
2. Infiniti

10. BMW
16. Benz
19. Saab

Yet the bottom line seems to be that even tho Infiniti sells great cars, it has never developed the cachet of Lexus, much less BMW, etc. So it is desperate to sell cars. It is trying to rebuild its line (and Nissan) out of the slump brought on by the weak Yen and the success of Lexus.

Of course, the problem is that it seems to be caring more about GETTING customers than keeping customers.

Unless I get this car for below invoice, I won't take the chance on crappy product or service.

Am I right?"
221,"November 12, 2003 9:05AM",bimmer97,"I think the s60r is nice inside , has soft leather all around, infiniti has more hard plastic. imo orange gauges look horrible in g35 while volvo has cool looking blue.
clutch is stiffer in g35, volvo has a light but spring loaded feel. the shifter of the G vibrates and takes a lot to get used to when shifting into reverse (Far right and downward motion) volvo doesn't vibrate and shifts into reverse more normally( what i'm used to)
both look good but have totally different looks G 35 has that japanesse looks whiel volvo has a more sedated euro look.
volvo steering feels looser at low parking lot speeds but tightens up when speed is increased. G-35 feels a little tight. both stick to the road and both seemed like they stop pretty well. i did not feel tubro lag and s60 had pop when accelating. s60 is awd and weighs more(don't need awd in Fla) i think the s60 is a little faster and hold a little better big 18"" wheels w P zero's.
so my delema is which one do i get.
what will hold up betterin the long term. s60r is awd which i guess is nice but really isn't needed in Fla.
one is more expensive but is damm good both in and out. one is cheaper looks better out then in.
I think the g35 sedan wont hold value as well as the s60r because they will be produced in greater quanity.
any opinions would be appreciated."

BMW get some nice comments as well but RIGHT NOW - the only thing that matters is what the math works out to be on a deal done today. By virtue of today's lease residuals it costs less to buy G coupea as opposed to a 330ci ~ all else equal.

You're not wrong to say that people have historically paid more for used Bimmers e it's true. Now the reality is people will pay the most for a G coupe of any car out there. Infiniti has had great cars for thier entire existence and now the market has bidded up one car int he lineup to reflect this. BMW manages it's used car markets better than anyone and perhaps Nissan learned something. History is nice but inadequate in most cases to accurately determine future trends. People who look backwards only in portfolio management get fired. In fact the real finds are in places where history has not been so kind."

You are correct, lease residuals are enforce for a deal done in this specific minute. They can change in one day.

Read the article. The bank buys the residual info from some one who analyzes the market. IF not Kiplinger then who. Even if they are reporting the facts only...you can say you've seen this change.

RE the financial discussion perhaps we should take it elsewhere. The only fundamental principal held by Chartered Financial Analysts, the highest designation for institutional money managers is having a basis for representing to a client that an invstment is suitable based on his needs. This specifically has to based on forward looking fundamentals. Reversion to the mean priciples suggests that what has done well in the past will not in the future and vice versa.

$100 difference. Just wanted to throw some numbers out there. Personally, I lease what I like and don't let residuals make the choice for me. My A4 has a much lower residual than both the G35 or the BMW, but I enjoy the heck out of it.

My 2 cents

Speed"
240,"November 13, 2003 10:34AM",kdshapiro,Interesting comparing apples to apples leasecompare.com gave slightly over a 50% residual on the G35.
241,"November 13, 2003 10:43AM",chrisboth,"""old information"" It does not reflect what actually happens currently. IE not real time such as the awesome TMV sponsored by this site.

It's a better residual now there is no going back"

243,"November 13, 2003 11:52AM",speedracer3,"BTW...leasecompare.com uses residuals from leasing companies. Most folks will lease through the manufacturer's financing arm, and those residuals tend to be much better than those from leasing companies. If NMAC wants to to subsidise 66% residuals, that's ok, I am sure the money factor is adjusted for the higher residual anyway so it balances out."
244,"November 30, 2003 8:15PM",georgi1,"speedracer, you are right. In cases where companies offer higher residuals they would demand high interest (or money factors, if you'd prefer). In my experience the manufacturer's own financial company usually gives the higher residuals. However, beware that even though the monthly payments of high-res/high-mf & low-res/low-mf come out the same, if you decide to buy the vehicle at lease-end you would have to pay more for the higher residual. Personally, I've found the residual values on cars.com to better reflect what I see on used-car listings."
245,"December 1, 2003 6:08AM",kdshapiro,"""you decide to buy the vehicle at lease-end you would have to pay more for the higher residual.""

Then one should be buying outright from the beginning. Leasing for 3 years and then buying is more expensive than buying outright from the beginning."
246,"December 1, 2003 7:06AM",mariner7,"As everyone should know, Nissan/Infiniti fortunes have changed completely the last few years, including residuals, so the past is not much of an indication. Apparently there's a auto research that predicts five year residuals, and obviously G35 is not five year old yet. It predicts the G coupe will have the best five year residual in its class, which includes 330Ci.

In the non-premium market, Nissan residuals are moving closer to the perennial leaders Honda & Toyota."

253,"January 2, 2004 5:21PM",raher,"I looked at buying a BMW 330i when I was looking at the 04TL. I bought the new TL ( auto with NAV ) because the equivelant features on the BMW were $10K more. Everything was ""extra"". I am sure the 330i is a killer ride and will outperform the TL in the twisty parts of the road ( but by how much?). Then again even after paying many extra $$$ for the performance package..the 330i is still down 35hp to the TL. I used to road race motorcycles and if I only had a buck for every time I passed people in a corner only to watch them go flying past on the straight because they had more hp. How many of you actually drive your cars hard enough in a corner to get the extra benefit of the RWD on the 330i ? Many of you do however drive fast on the freeway in a relatively straight line or drive in the snow. I'll take the $10G's and the 35hp and the stereo and the NAV and on and on and on."

That is exactly the question. When you plunk down $35K for a TL when you can get a perfectly acceptable Hyundia for $12K, you start to ask yourself, is the extra $23K worth it. Is the TL over 3000% better? Of course it isn't. You just like to make yourself feel better when you think your paying less for something that you believe to be equivalent and you are really making out -because there is something that can't be used that cost money in the other item, but people can't take advantage of it.

That is the whole value equation in life. For me, either I'll get the Hyundia and pocket the $23K difference, or I'll spring for the extra $10K."

258,"January 2, 2004 7:37PM",saugatak,"don't get into a debate with kd on value because to him, if you're not spending the money to drive a bmw, you might as well save as much as possible and buy a hyundai.

i don't think there's any right answer on value. bmw has prestige and road handling that is in a class by itself and if you must have those 2 things, then spending the extra money for the bmw is worth it.

if prestige does not matter to you and you're happy with a car which handles 90% as well as a BMW, then clearly it's not worth it to get the BMW.

everyone's value system and economic means are different and results in different valuations of cars. if i'm making $50 million a year, i don't care about a $10k difference in car prices between a bmw and something else (it's less than 1% of my net worth) and i'll get what i want. if i'm making $50k a year, that extra $10k represents a much greater portion of my income (20% of my net worth) and i would not part with it unless i felt the car was 20% better.

frankly, i'm sick and tired of the FWD vs. RWD debate. i have driven a ton of both FWD and RWD cars and just b/c a car is RWD doesn't mean it automatically drives better than a FWD car. Mercedes for example makes a pretty fine car, and it's RWD, but most Benzes I have ever driven have not been the greatest handling cars (Please note that I have not driven every model Benz, just going by personal exp. so no need to flame me for above statement).

For example, I had to drive my cousin's ML320 this weekend to get more food for my New Year's Party (his car was the last one in the driveway so was the only one available).

Well the seats and the sound system in the ML320 were great. The stiff steering, the sway in turns, and lack of feel on the road were awful. I hit double curves at 70 MPH in that ML320 to test it out and came out thinking, hmmm, this was a bad idea. The ML320 is a nice luxury car and has a much nicer interior than my Acura MDX, but in terms of handling, my FWD MDX kicks the RWD ML320."

I'm not advocating any one car, because I think they are both excellent cars for the individual who wants to purchase them.

I do like to play devils advocate when someone says why pay top dollar for car x, when car y offers almost the same for less and anyway you'll never use all of car x's ability. That's all well and good but you have to add the four little letters: IMHO. Who is anybody to suggest to ME, how I should spend MY money and whether a particular car is worth it to ME and whether I will or won't derive any added benefit for paying more? This train of thought can be applied against any two vehicles.

That being said, sometimes people will compare vehicles that are not really in the same target market and look at each vehicle on their own merits and then make a choice. Sometimes it doesn't matter if you get a two or seven seater and you can compare the two seater with the seven seater and each can be good in their own right. And a point in time either can satisify your requirements.

saugatak - this is not a BMW thread and comparing these two vehicles has nothing to do with BMW. I am very familiar with both cars and each of these are fine vehicles in their own right. They offer different qualities that make them very attractive to potential purchasers. There is not one worldly overridding value equation that would make anyone jump at one car or another. If there were, a manufacturer wouldn't be able to give their vehicles away."

You continually go around demanding that everyone respect your choice of car, but you show absolutely no respect for any other person's choice of car--unless of course that person chooses a BMW.

You continuously make fun of the TL, you say that you prefer the looks of a Lexus ES330 over a TL but you also like the looks of the pre-Bangle and post-Bangle BMWs but don't like the look of Pontiac Grand Ams (real headscratcher), you keep saying if you're not getting a BMW buy a Hyundai, you say the criticism of Consumer Review is worthless because it ranked the TL over the BMW (I didn't notice any such criticism when the BMW was ranked above the TL), I mean this list is endless.

The only consistent theme in your wildly inconsistent statements is BUY BMW (do you own shares?). You keep talking about your objectivity but I don't see it.

I don't know what CR said, since the only issue I have is the 2004 Auto Guide. In that issue CR said something like the Accord is almost as good as the 2004 TL for $5K less.

And I'll say it again, unabashedly...if you want the best driving dynamics the 3-series is the benchmark. The 3-series isn't for everyone just like the TL isn't for everyone, but it is the benchmark in the entry level luxo sports sedan market.

269,"January 3, 2004 12:42AM",kominsky,"When I was car shopping in the early 90's, I had just been blessed with my first child and was, accordingly, shopping for my first ""family"" car. CR had a shootout involving the Honda Accord and the Toyota Camry. The Accord, according to them, had better road feel, better acceleration, better brakes, better handling, etc (they labelled it the ""driver's car"" of the comparison). The Camry, on the other hand, was quieter, had better trunk access, was slightly larger (if I remember correctly), etc. The Camry won the comparison based on stuff that was mostly unimportant to me but was definitely important to others. (FWIW, I ended up with an Altima, but that was based on a financial decision above all else... for as reliable as it was, I never really liked that car).

jrock - at times you appear to be articulate, so here is a further explanation. The above quote from the original poster is an opinion, but it's also appears to be a thinly veiled opinion disguised as jealously. To reach that conclusion I draw on my own experience. I said similiar things to a friend of mine who wanted to purchase a 911. I asked him how he could justify the purchase of a 911 because the roads are crowded and you'll never be able to use all of the abilities of the car anyway and you are never going to track it. Why don't you get an M5 it's about half the price?

He said to me: ""Because I want it and I can."" Now that was me being jealous. I think we all do this stuff. Now jrock - let me add IMHO.

But we could beat this till the cows come home. CR does provide objective, factual information. I have been a reader since I was 16. And I do trust more than any other magazine their factually gathered information on autos. However, my reliability experience with cars has not jived in the past with theirs. In addition, as kominsky stated above, my priorities have not meshed with their priorities. When they pick a top rated sedan, they do so for general populace. Sometimes it's just not the car I'm looking for due to other reasons, and I pick a car that's not quite top-rated by them, but offers me what I need."
273,"January 3, 2004 8:12AM",kennyg5,"IMHO, the BMW 3 series is the best handling car in the bunch, hands down. Moreover, you get the prestige of a ""premium"" nameplate if you don't mind giving up heated leather seats, sunroof, CD changer, nav and other niceties that are included in a comparably priced TL. Also, if you are single or have a family with small kids only (rear seat space and trunk size), the BMW is ideal because its relatively smaller size enhances nimbleness. If you are concerned about snow (RWD), get the new AWD Beemer, which costs a couple of grand more.

Having said all of the above, I would rather get the G35, which gives up little (if any) in performance and handling when compared with the Beemer, and use the $$ savings in filling up the gas tank that gives me miles of driving pleasure, plus the reliability of Infiniti to boot :-)"

Keep in mind that the IS300 does have a 5-speed manual. 5th is a slight overdrive. You can only get the 5-speed manual in the sedan. The SportCross version comes only with the 5-speed automatic.

You can get LSD with both transmissions, but you can only get Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) with the automatic.

Can be a bit hard to find a 5-speed manual. Many Lexus dealers aren't keen on them since the overwhelming vast majority of Lexi ever sold had automatics. Check with some dealers.

My post was the one that started this discussion and it is interesting that most of the subsequent discussions weren't discussions about the cars but were mostly personal discussions about the people posting.
I don't think I neeed to put IMHO on anything I write since it should be apparent that it is my opinion because I am writing it !
My point was more along the lines of value for performance and ""near luxury"". I think the TL is the winner on those merits because I get more for my money with the TL. Paying an extra $10K for the prestige of the BMW name is OK if what you want is prestige. I am sure the guy in the 330i I blew off at the stoplight the other day is telling himself he has more ""prestige"".
I am not sure every 330i owner is going to lose me on twisty road sections but I do know what 35hp in a straight line means. It means he better lose me in the twisty sections because he will give it back when the road straightens out.
For the $10K I didn't spend on the BMW 330i do you suppose I could make even more performance improvements or make many ""near luxury"" improvements to my TL? Oh, that's right the TL already comes with more than the BMW !
I saw a 2004 535i yesterday....not a pretty car."
276,"January 3, 2004 10:12AM",kdshapiro,"Some people don't focus on the value side of the equation. I do and I don't and it depends on what I'm getting. Sometimes I want the best. I felt the $5K more for the driving experience of a BMW is worth every penny. I spend a lot of time in my car and this is the most fun I've ever had. Keep your supposed goodies.

The 3 series goes to 60 in 5.6 seconds and has a top speed of 153, does the quarter mile at about 98 and 14.(recent Car and Driver). I'm sure the guy you blew off at the light was laughing at you thinking: ""this guy has a new car and has to show it off, it's just not worth it"". Stop light races never impress me. Let's go to the track.

If you believe people buy BMW for prestige, than all people have to buy the upscale brands for prestige as well. After all why would one buy a BMW for prestige, but not an Acura, the upscale division of Honda, for prestige? If one wants to argue about the amount of ""prestige"" a car has go ahead. I sincerely believe people buy a car because of the reputation of the manufacturer.

One list thing about value. I don't need to be told a TL has more value than a 330, a Honda Accord has more value than a TL, a Mazda 6 four-banger has more value than an Accord, an Elantra has more value than a Mazda 6 four-banger. It's a given, the less you spend on a car the more value it has because it is fulfilling a basic need of getting you from point a to point b. What somebody on this forum would want to know is what is the rational for purchasing one vehicle over another. Prestige, poseurs, kinds of people who buy automobiles etc, don't answer that question, they are only self-serving reasons.

The last tome I looked at comparison stats the 330i handled about 90-95% as well as the G...Prestige notwithstanding.

As far as CR being reliable in terms of performance oriented reviews, I agree with KDShapiro in that they targtet the mass buyer and will point out some very intersting negatives occasionally. There are many IMO that will agree that they are a little more camry and minivan comparison worthy than 350Z and ZHP worthy. 50,000 acre test facililty wont get them better drivers or more enthused drivers.

All the arguments about the price/value equation have the same old value is in the eye of the beholder ending. The thing people forget with the G is that prestige is not paid for in the diplacement department and if a hypothetical buyer wants to get into the low 14 game with world class brakes and handling, he can get it for 28k. Want a comparable 330i and how much is it? 10k more at least. The whole value thing gets blown out of proportion and people need to relilze that BMW is excxlusive in that they will beat you to death with any options and everything is optional. That add'l .5 litres is a big nut and takes a very reasonable platform that can be had for a pretty good priced and makes it the same price as a 5 series.

Someone above said you could spend 20k more than a 3 and just get the 5 series - NO - you can spend less and get a 5 series in some cases. The 3 is pricey cuz people will pay it. It's called good marketing and great product/name perceptions."
280,"January 3, 2004 12:26PM",kdshapiro,"""It's called good marketing and great product/name perceptions.""

Yes and I'd like to add it's also called execution and delivery. BMW products deliver. They are not an empty shill.

Chris it's always about value. It never stops being about value, but everybodys' definition is different. That is why some people will buy a $70K Rolex and some people a $10 Timex. Who am I to tell the $70K Rolex buyer it does not represent good value to them. They after all both tell time.

I can't. You can only buy what you believe fits you and your lifestyle. You will buy as much as finances allow, not less. That's why you ridicule a Hyundia. Think of how the less fortunate must feel when they get their first new Hyundia."

Second, I don't understand why BMW just does not up the horsepower in its inline 6s. Those engines have been around for a while. With all the work BMW has done on its VANOS V8s, surely they can migrate some of the technology down and free up some additional horsepower.

I've heard that Honda has the ability to get 350 HP out of its basic SOHC VTEC v6 engine. If true, that is amazing engineering and good news for Acura fans because we'll always be ahead of everyone else when it comes to the HP game. Of course, Honda had better make a RWD platform soon so we can take advantage of that power!

No matter what BMW fans say about ""Well I could beat u on the track"" or ""I don't have torque steer"" or ""if the roads were winding you'd eat my dust"", fact is raw horsepower is incredibly useful and most racing occurs not in tracks or windy roads, but on freeways or from stop light to stop light.

Every time I'm merging into the right line of a busy highway with a short exit ramp and I see that 6-ton trailer coming in my rear view mirror, I'm glad for all the horses I have and am happy for more.

I find that these discussions always start off comparing value, driving dynamics, prestige, etc. but at some point the ULTIMATE ARGUMENT gets unleashed: ""Keep telling yourself how much better your car is while you eat my dust and look at my car's disappearing [non-permissible content removed].""

It's great that TL drivers can make the ultimate argument."

Actually raher, you have been nasty. I spent a lot of time at the track when I was younger. I'm not saying BMW is the be all and end all but performance and value, are completely opposite. If you think the TL will track better than the 3 series more power to you. BTW racing non-street legal cars is a whole different ball game than taking your street legal almost unmodified car to the track.

Hey raher, my Bimmer has been to the shop..oh lets' see May 2003 last, before that August 2002. I think once a year to the shop for an oil change is sufficient. Total out of pocket costs to date: $0. I think it qualifies as reliable.

BTW what point are you trying to make in your post????"

What was your first clue ? What is your point ?
I am fairly certain that the statistics on repairs etc for BMW's probably include a few more cars than just yours. I am on my third Acura and have never had a problem. Acura is rated as the number one most reliable automobile between 1999-2003 by your favorite uninformed magazine, Consumer Reports.
My point in the original post ( remember I started this discussion ) and my continuing point on this subject is that for $35K I believe the '04 Acura TL is the best value out there in a 4 door automobile. What you get for a given amount of money is one way to measure value. You get more for $35K in the TL than any of it's competitors.

I don't have that info from the mag handy, but that 330i apparently had the performance pack. Add in all the options already included in the TL and it looks to me to stack up something like this:
TL - $33K
330i - $47K

maybe someone can correct me if i'm wrong."
293,"January 3, 2004 7:31PM",pg48477,"You absolutily right, comparable equipped 330 does cost more that10K over TL.

And one more thing 330 for 35K does not have better performance in any way. Like KD, I am going to make Huyndai example her. 330 without performance package is like Huyndai in every way in and out."
294,"January 3, 2004 10:29PM",kdshapiro,"Correct but you still get a car that will outhandle the TL on a track, or a street.

According to our worthless source CR, the standard 330i will outhandle the standard G35. I am sure the standard G35 will outhandle the standard TL. Therefore the standard 330i will outhandle the standard TL.

I don't begrudge the TL anything, you can have your goodies, but I'll take the driving experience. For those who think the 330 with performance package costs $47, Blueguydotcom got his for about $39K. You might want to search the 3-series board for more information. No, it wasn't a stripper.

If this car makes it to production (and it probably will), it will leave the 330i in the dust and give the 5-Series a run for its money."
298,"January 4, 2004 3:24AM",zumbalak,"I saw the arguments about the TL and the 330. It is all about the buyer's choice. I love my 03 M3 and I also love my 03 G35. They are IMHO exceptional cars for the price I paid. I believe m3 handling can not be easily matched with a car in the same price range, except the corvette. g35 is also an excellent car and handles almost as good as the 330, i got the g because i didn't want another bmw 3 series. the car is exceptional when it comes to performance and the looks, many people talk to me about the car in parking lots and gas stations. meanwhile an m3 is as we know m3.
i recently test drove the tl (actually borrowed it from the dealer - manager is my friend) and there was so much hype about the car, so i got it for a couple of hours (their demo) drove around the town. and i was quite impressed, it is a way better car than the old tl. but the hype in my opinion is not well worth.
the sound system works excellent if you actually have a dvd audio disc (they had one that was sent from the factory i think) and it is just excellent quality. but when you put a regular cd it is nothing ordinary.
the performance, it has excellent pick up, but the fwd downgrades the potential of this car. whatever others say, there is the torque steer, this car would have been excellent as an rwd, and i think as far as the pick up (in street start the g will beat the tl, well we know m3 performance is something else)
the interior is good quality but does not match the refinement of the bmw 3 series or the audi or the mb, but better than the g. the interior space was less than the g along with the trunk space. i guess the g is a larger car overall and that makes a lot of difference, especially for me with a family and lots of people in the car at all times. i think interior space is similar to 3 series sedan. i am 6'3"" and with my seating position there was almost no space at the back of the driver's seat (a similarity to the 3 sedan)
the handling of the car is not as refined as the 3 or the g. i realized this when i was entering a highway ramp at about 60-65 mph, and felt the need to hold the steering wheel with both hands very steady because the car almost got out of the road. it was a scary moment, and such wouldn't happen with a rwd 3 series or the g or the quattro audi. the handling is of course no issue in straight roads, but not everybody drives crazy like me in the backroads.
i would prefer an audi quattro, 3 series or the g for backroads, mountain roads, but definitely not a tl. the car just didn't make me feel comfortable enough, kind of made me scared in a couple of situations.
the looks are not so much in my style, it feels so dull and very accord like. it doesn't have a unique feeling of itself. i think they should have worked on the looks a little bit longer.
overall the tl is an excellent value for an ordinary daily driver. it offers so much for so less, good interior, good performance, good safety features, and a low msrp.
but for those who don't mind spending the extra cash i know that many will opt for other vehicles. acura tl in my opinion is the choice for first time near-luxo car buyers who do not have the ability of spending another 5k without worrying about their pockets.

i am looking forward to the new vette and most likely i will be the first in line to add the car into my garage. and then maybe trade in the g for the 05 audi a6 quattro.

meanwhile the argument of bmw is better than tl better than mb better than g better than this that can go on forever. but one need to know that everybody has a different budget, and different reason for buying a car. some people may not mind spending 40k, some people may only afford 34k some can not even afford that and some go out and buy a ferrari for 200k. instead of comparing i think it is best to drive the car and enjoy the purchase.

i honestly did not see a ferrari owner and a lamborghini owner fighting and arguing about their cars and try to prove one is better than the other.

301,"January 4, 2004 9:03AM",kdshapiro,"A new 2004 Accord drove up into my driveway last night. It had all the goodies, sat/nav etc. Out the door price was a little over $28K. The TL with nav is about $35K. After tooling around in this vehicle I realized the only reason that people would go for the TL at $7K more or the TSX which is a four-banger is the ""so-called"" prestige factor of the Acura brand.

You could never derive the additional $7K in driving benefit from a TL. And it beats the TSX hands down. For the price/feature content this car beats 'em all. Of course it is FWD and if you are happy with that you will probably be getting a reliable Honda, with a powerful engine and a smooth drive train.

After thinking about it I can see why there might be some people who don't want to spring for the extra money for a 330i to get it identically optioned. It's because the perception is they are actually getting less for their money. I can now see that, as I believe when you buy a TL with nav etc your money has hit the point of diminishing returns against a similiarly equipped Accord. You are actually paying more money to get less car.

While I really wanted an X3 due to the NE climate, I might have to reverse myself and say the Honda with nav and such offers the best bang for the buck (even though it has torque steer and fwd) and save myself $12 grand, which I can use towards my kids college education or home improvements."

Ensure you add the available performance options like LSD to SRT-4 and the Brembo brake package to the Spec V. Then compare these cars, which cost around $20,000, to the 330i or TL. That SRT-4 will run (run over?) the TL or 330i and save you a small fortune in the process. But is it a legitimate comparison?

304,"January 4, 2004 11:42AM",riez,"pg48477... You prove my point. If luxury is the primary criteria, then why are people obsessing about performance numbers? And if price/value is the primary criteria, then there are a lot ""better"" less expensive cars out there.

And that leaves us the dilemma of this board: What does it mean to be a ""near luxury performance sedan""? Are luxury and performance equal? Or is performance more important than luxury? Or vice versa?

I firmly believe in performance taking precedence, but not at the expense of luxury. And other factors like reliability, warranty, customer service, operating costs, etc. cannot be left out of the equation.

But if you don't define terms and weight what is important, all you do is debate apples and oranges? Or Granny Smith apples vs. Red Delicious apples?"

308,"January 4, 2004 12:18PM",saugatak,"Think that's a topic for another board, but I don't think anyone can argue that v6 Camry or v6 Accord (will refer to them as CamCord from now on) give you best bang for buck. Yes, you can get a lower brand car but the CamCord is renowned for its reliability and low gas mileage and due to its reliability has a low Total Cost of Ownership (TCO).

With respect to the price differential between a nav-Accord and a nav-TL, I agree the nav-Accord wins in the value equation, but from what I've read (somebody with more exp. with both systems please help me out) the Acura's nav system is a lot better. I have not bought any nav systems in my cars to this point (I find a $20 map/atlas that I can carry from car to car is a pretty unbeatable value) so I don't know this for sure, but my understanding is that the nav system on the TL allows you to say ""Phone Home"" and then the car will dial the number for you, whereas this is not possible on the nav-equipped Accord.

Now this may seem silly to you but I kind of dig this feature a lot for 3 reasons:

1) I never use a cell phone when driving (unless I'm stuck in traffic and need to tell someone I'll be late) because it's dangerous so to be able to make voice-activated calls is incredibly useful. Time is money and if I can conduct some business while on the phone and save some time, the Nav system on the TL could pay for itself. Also, if you must talk on the phone, this is a much safer way to do it and could save your life, which is definitely worth something.

2) One of my favorite shows as a kid was Knight Rider (in spite of David Hasselhoff) because the talking corvette with the roving Cylon eye was just so cool. There is a fun factor in talking to your car and getting a response back that is hard to quantify.

3) If I buy the TL, it'll be the 6MT so with a stick in right hand and wheel in left hand, voice-activated calling is really more than a luxury, it's almost a necessity.

The point is although objectively the nav-Accord beats the nav-TL, I think there are some good reasons to spring the extra $ for the superior Acura nav./voice system.

With respect to the current generation v6 Accords, I found that Honda took all the driving fun out of the current gen. Accord. To me, they have the driving feel of a Camry and frankly, the Camry is a better Camry than the Accord is. When you compare prices on the non-nav Accord v6 and non-nav TL, I think the price difference is only $3,700 (based on my market research that I could get the Accord for $600 over invoice and the TL for $2k under MSRP based on what's been posted on the prices paid boards).

I think the extra $3,700 is money well spent to upgrade from non-nav Accord to non-nav TL. Also, I really want a 6MT and unfortunately the Accord sedan does not come in 6MT and v6. I'd have to get the Accord 6MT v6 Coupe.

And my wife's response when I suggested that we save some cash on my car by me getting the Accord 6MT Coupe was: ""I always sit in the front and you are responsible for putting son in the back seat and pulling him out of the back seat.""

Well I like to save money like the next guy, but destroying my back is not the way I'm gonna do it so it's the TL for me."
309,"January 4, 2004 12:31PM",saugatak,"I don't normally defend kdshapiro, but I really think that his basic point that ""value is in the eyes of the beholder"" is correct.

It's kind of hard to compare the TL to any BMW b/c pricewise it's closer to the 3-series but sizewise it's comparable to the 5-series.

If you are someone who places a high premium on being able to hit 270 degree exit ramps at 65 and really enjoys driving your car beyond 8/10ths on twisty roads, there really is just one sedan out there for you and that's BMW. Also as someone who drove a 3-series in his 20s, I have to say that I had a much, much easier time picking up hot girls with that car than any other car I've had before or since.

I think if you exclude the 2 factors I mentioned above, the TL whomps the BMW 3-series, but getting hot girls with minimal efforts is, as they say in the MasterCard commercial, PRICELESS.

Thus, if you can't say it for the Accord, you can't logically say it for the 330i."
315,"January 4, 2004 1:51PM",riez,"We always end up apples to oranges because we can't agree on even the most basic of things. For example, what is the relevant price spread? Is it under $40K? Over $25K but less than $45K? For me, I think the ""meat"" of this market segment is in the $27,500-$32,500 range but this segment includes outliers costing at least $25K but no more than $35K. But notice how subjective everything is?

Thus, for me, the 330i comparison should be with a stripped one, not a loaded one. The loaded ones and the 330i with Perf. Pkg push $40K. To me, $40K is squarely in the realm of luxury performance sedan. There ain't no ""near"" at $40K. That is why I went with a loaded IS300 manual for approx. $32,500 MSRP when a similar 330i was nearly $40K. For $32,500 MSRP I could get a decently equipped (but just) 325i but not a 330i. (And I don't want to bring in ED issue.)

Wish we had three boards. One for FWD, one for AWD, and one for RWD. For me, there is no such thing as a ""performance"" FWDer. That is an oxymoron. And I wouldn't want the weight penalty that AWD brings.

As the saying goes on American Idol - ""I beg to diffa"". Your statement is incorrect to the extent it is not the size or weight of a 3 series. Yes you can make a go-cart perform better than a three series, but make the Mini-cooper 3300 lbs, give it four ""real"" seats and it wouldn't outhandle a go-cart. With 0 to 60 acceleration of 8 seconds, I'm not sure how it outperforms the 330i. But in it's weight class, it just does fine. The SRT4 also outperformns the 330i, but add an additional 400lbs or so and it wouldn't accelerate it's way out of a paper-bag. Add 500lbs and 2 more seats to an S2000 to make it's weight equivalent to a 3 series and it wouldn't perform either. Yes it's very easy to make a car that out accelerates any other car, just cut down on seats, and mitigate with weight and you've got a winner. But we are not talking about these types of cars.

To some paying the additional $$$ for a 330i, a vehicle with the best drivetrain in the business, smoothest in-line six, vaunted handling is worth it. To others it's not. What's so hard about that?"

pp - the 330 goes to 60 in 5.6 seconds. It is what it is. It also goes to 60 in 7.5 seconds. Yes there is a range of performance a range of models and a range of price. It is what it is. If you feel better in saying the TL is faster to 60. I'm not gonna disagree."
331,"January 5, 2004 6:43AM",riez,"As with price and performance, this is subjective. Which I have repeatedly stressed. For me, there is no such thing as a ""performance"" automatic. And the performance and fun-to-drive factor of even a Ferrari automatic pails in comparison to the same experience with a manual.

And keep in mind that SMG-type systems (used by Ferrari, Maserati, BMW, Aston Martin, etc.) are NOT automatics. They are manual transmissions with software and systems to allow an automatic mode but still don't have a torque converter.

And, yes, cars as expensive as the new MB McLaren are still not true performance cars. What is up with a hyper expensive ""supercar"" with a 5-speed MB automatic transmission? Even AutoWeek ran a poll on this issue.

shenkar... I stand by my subjective opinion. A Ferrari with an automatic transmission is a travesty, one reflected in the future resale market. It is less than what a Ferrari could and should be.

kahunah... And your 270 HP TL FWDer will also out torque steer my car. Too much weight over front wheels which are also drive wheels. FWDers can never escape the laws of physics.

pg48477... The IS300 sedan is about 54/46. The SportCross (wagon) is about 53/47. Not 50/50 but certainly not 60/40. (Lexus should've moved the battery to the trunk.)"

333,"January 5, 2004 9:23AM",shenkar,"I guess it depends on your definition of ""performance"".

I'll agree that on the racetrack or on the twisty-bits, the manual equipped car will generally rule...all else being equal. But on the drag strip, or in stoplight skirmishes, the situation is generally reversed. Even the car mags acknowledge this. Therefore they BOTH deliver performance...just a different kind. And while that may not meet your individual subjective standard, but please don't denigrate cars because of that.

I, for one, would love to have an E55 which I think you'll agree could blow the doors off 96% on the cars on the road today...regardless of transmissions.

BTW...applying the personal bias you've expressed to the equation, does this mean that your automatic IS is not a ""performance"" car, but your 5 speed is, by virtue of the transmission only???"
334,"January 5, 2004 12:05PM",riez,"My WIFE's '03 IS300 automatic is her ""performance"" car. She cannot drive a manual transmission. MY '04 IS300 manual is a performance car.

And the 540i6 didn't have LSD! BMW only offers that in M3 and M5.

And I can make the same case for my former '96 Impala SS (5.7L V8 and 4-speed automatic) versus my former '97 Camaro (3.8L V6, with Perf, Handling, & Suspension Pkg, and 5-speed manual). Take the manual any day! Much more fun to drive. But if you like to be driven, an automatic is just fine."
335,"January 5, 2004 12:27PM",fedlawman,"Your assertion that a car must be RWD to be a ""true"" sports car is preposterous.

Compare the IS300 to the Mazda 6s. Both cars are within a hair of each other in HP, TQ, 0-60 and 1/4 mile acceleration, skidpad grip, slalom speed, and braking distances.

Even the weight distribution is close (54/46 vs. 59/41).

Yes, dynamically FWD and RWD perform differently. From a standing start, the IS300 has an advantage over the Mazda 6 because it has better traction to the drive wheels. On a racetrack however, that advantage is gone, as it simply requires a different driving technique (line) to make a FWD go fast vs. a RWD.

Basically, going around a road course quickly involves three elements - power-to-weight ratio, braking performance, and traction. In corners, traction is key because the more you have, the more power you can put down on the pavement. The factor that most affects traction is weight transfer, which is why smoothness is so important for fast lap times.

Compared to a FWD car, in a RWD car, turn-in happens sooner because during braking (entry), weight shifts away from the drive wheels, and the resulting loss of traction can cause oversteer. Since turn-in is earlier, the apex also comes sooner, causing the line to straighten and allow the driver to begin accelerating. This technique obviously won't work well in a FWD car because the ""wrong wheels"" need the traction to exit the corner. Therefore, weight transfer through a corner must be managed differently for a FWD car.

If you're piloting a FWD car into a corner, you adjust your line by braking and turning-in later. This adjusts the line by moving the apex out farther. With a later apex, the FWD'er straightens the line through the turn and can accelerate harder, sooner.

It may not seem as natural to you, but it is no less effective at producing fast lap times.

As far as torque steer is concerned - no it's not fun, but modern high performance FWD cars (like the Mazda 6 or Acura TL) have it managed very well, so if it's present at all, it's more of a distraction than a performance handcap.

Of course, all of this talk is moot on the street. At 8/10ths, it rarely comes into play.

For the most fun and biggest performance gains, attend a driving school and put good rubber on your wheels."

I just drove the new TL my dinner buddy purchased last week and watched the review on the TL on Speedchannel...cant remember the show as I was taking one of my 14 naps over the last two weeks and so was groggy at the time...but the reviewer hammered the thing for having too much power for a Front Driver.

 All the nice sentiment over FWD is great but the platform will have a limit that this car seems to exceed. The comment was the accord has about the right of power...anyone else see this so as to help me remember the show?

The very thing Rear Drivers enjoy is the differnt stlye of driving that reat powered cars afford us.....that little correction to puposefully oversteer to put the car in line as the weight transfers to the drive wheels is the majic that people wont give up. As a 10 year front driver...they are fun in turns - really...but not as fun and not as easy to apex as RWD.

The chatter from torque steer is one of the most unsettling things you can deal with - not for fear of losing control as FWD are easier to keep in contol...just feels cruddy when your driving and it feels like an earthquake is shaking the wheel...and combined with LSD and traction...its a little bit worse than my integra was."

338,"January 5, 2004 3:52PM",fedlawman,"I haven't driven the TL so I cannot comment on its torque steer. I do admit that 270 HP is a lot to send to the front wheels...

That said, while I don't believe FWD takes away from the fun to be had driving the TL, I do suspect that its 3700# curb weight makes it more of a Grand Tourer than a canyon carver.

I would take a TSX over the TL any day...and in fact, I did!"
339,"January 5, 2004 5:23PM",chrisboth,"ACura rocks in many ways - the TL is a sweet ride but it is not a sports sedan at 85-95% of the envelope - while it may perform in curves nearly as well - hell even as well - better? possibly with ASPEC, it won't feel as competently done.

 That late turn in the FWD offers is kinda neat and I enjoyed it in the acura's I've owned and driven but the rumbling torque steer over bumps or uneven pavement is a very unimpressive offering for you and your passengers in a heavy car even.

The tsx may be the best value for that market segment ever. It's very much like the TL in terms of appearance and stance...TSX owners must love it! And not vice versa"
340,"January 5, 2004 5:45PM",riez,"fedlawman... Please review the earlier recent posts. As I said, I am NOT talking smooth test track performance. Heck, using that criteria a FWDer with a live rear axle can be quite the performer. I'm talking on the real roads I drive every day. On the twisties. On the curves. On the bumps. (You really appreciate IRS when you are taking a nice sweeper fast and you hit a bump. When you lack IRS the entire rear bounces up in the air and you say a silent prayer. Not unlike torque steer!)

Today I had fun ""playing"" with my business FWD Sonata (V6, 5-speed manual with defeatable traction control) in the snow and ice. She tugs and pulls like crazy every time she loses traction. All that weight over the front wheels and those drive wheels trying to steer at the same time they fight for traction. You fight to steer her. Just take a corner as you lose some front wheel traction. Pulls left then right. Laws of physics. That is true for every FWDer I've ever driven hard. (And, yeah, I had fun driving '01 TL Type S but she torque steered. Same for the I35 Sport I drove.) Only way to go is to ensure the drive wheels are not the steering wheels!

Don't forget that 5% of 3,000 pounds is 150 pounds. FWDer is like having your pre-teen sitting on your hood all the time."
341,"January 5, 2004 5:47PM",saugatak,"FWD vs RWD has been debated to death. My personal take is that the difference is overrated.

MB makes RWD vehicles but how well do they handle? Every MB I've ever driven has been a nice car but handling wasn not really its strongest characteristic.

Lexus makes both FWD and RWD cars, but aside from Riez's favorite IS300 (LOL, he has 2 of 'em), I would really have to focus very hard to tell the difference in the drivetrain. A soft plushy ride completely divorced from any feel for the road sucks whether the drivetrain is a FWD or RWD.

If you really want to make a performance car, you not only have to have the RWD but you need to do all the other things it takes to get the weight balance as close to 50-50. Not sure what the exact weight balance on the IS300 is Riez, but it doesn't sound anywhere close to 50-50, so on that basis Infiniti G35 and BMW are going to be a lot better than IS300.

Also, I think if you are used to a RWD and then go to a FWD, the difference is really noticeable so you tend to overemphasize it. The opposite is also true.

For example, I'm now used to my MDX and when I had to drive an ML320, it took me a while to get used to the turns. Once I got used to it in 5 mins. it was fine.

I find that as long as I have some feel for the road, I can get used to just about any car and drive with my normal skill level, and after a while don't notice it unless I try to go above 7/10ths.

Living in the NE, I prefer FWD b/c I can slap on all seasons and not worry about snow tires. Yes, you can get a RWD/AWD sedan, but those are a lot heavier, so their performance is compromised and they eat up a lot more gas.

When I move to CA, where bad weather isn't as much of a problem, I'd give a lot more consideration to RWD, but I'm not going to let the drivetrain alone influence my decision as to which car I want."

But the point of the post, which you clearly missed, is that first you have to make a good handling car and then putting in a RWD drivetrain will make a difference.

I think a more valid comparison is the ES330 vs GS300. Both offer soft, plush rides with little road feel. ES330 has too little power to have any torque steer. Does the drivetrain really make a difference? I mean, how much do I care that a bad handling RWD car might handle slightly better than a bad handling FWD car? I would never push a bad handlng RWD car to the limits anyway so what have I gained with the RWD drivetrain?

It's very interesting to me that the accord popped up a few times in this thread about near luxury cars.

I must say that the 240hp accord seemed more powerful than the BMW, with only marginally worse handling. granted I was not on a race track, but this is everyday driving.

I also must say that this accord had every possible option and is $4,000 cheaper than the BMW that has almost no options (not even power seats!) I was amazed that you could actually talk to the navigation system.

Finally, I was amazed at how plush the honda was and how spartan the BMW was. the BMW was almost embarassingly uncomfortable on the inside.

All this being said, can anyone really justify goping with the BMW here? Also, can anyone justify spending $4k more for the Acura TL.

Maybe go for the BMW because of 1) all wheel drive and 2) prestige of driving a BMW?

Please let me know, Thank you."

riez and kd, I wonder how far you two push you RWD cars. I have a TL and I really in to cars so I have driven quiet a few RWD and FWD cars. With that said do you really know your cars limits, I bet you don't, because if you do you must of crash it a few times (or be really close to it) to understand were exactly the limit is. In order to compare RWD and FWD you really have to spend alot of time driving each one and really push it to the limit, and that would only be possible only on the race trace or on the empty road at night. I don't think any of you two had this kind of experience and for this meter so as anybody else on this side including myself. So if you think that RWD is better than FWD that is your opinion, not a fact, and it varies from car to car. While 330 in my opinion has a slight advantage over TL in handling, there is no way you can take advantage of it. As for IS, in my opinion it does not even handle as good as TL, so just leave it a that."
352,"January 5, 2004 9:49PM",kdshapiro,"pp...it was written tongue in cheek...forgot the smiley...:)

But to answer the question, I push the car pretty darn hard. I don't drive to smash 'er up or to race it, but the predictable response, smooth drivetrain and communicative steering let's me do almost anything. Now could a professional push it harder, absolutely.

Honda Accord V6 to a BMW 325 for $28,000. To me it's no contest, the Honda is very nice at that price. I never go for loaded cars, but there is a certain level of options that I want. A $28,000 BMW does not have it. Having just driven a loaded Honda Accord, I can say it drives very nicely. Could I see myself driving it? Absolutely? Does it handle anywhere close to my 330i. Not a chance. But if the sport in sports sedan doesn't matter, it's a compelling choice.

""I have a TL and I really in to cars so I have driven quiet a few RWD and FWD cars.""

Me too, including a 911.

""So if you think that RWD is better than FWD that is your opinion, not a fact, and it varies from car to car. While 330 in my opinion has a slight advantage over TL in handling, there is no way you can take advantage of it.""

pp - I agree. If you're idea of handling is to plow threw snow with all-seasons a FWD will outdo a RWD. But I can feel the difference between a great FWD and a great RWD. It is no contest. Does it make a difference going to work on traffic clogged streets. No. But that is not what this conversation is about, or else we would all be driving Hyundais (sorry shenkar that's the last of it). A great RWD will be able to outperform in the aggregate a great FWD, because of the balance and power delivery. As I said it doesn't make a difference in traffic cloggeds streets, but that is not what this conversation is about. What drive-train one chooses is a personal preference. They each have their advantages and limitations.

But let's not confuse the ability of the car with the ability of the driver or amount of traffic on the road."

There is no voodoo or gospel here and no marketing hype. Marketing hype is what got FWD to suceed. RWD platfroms offer a lot of good things to a paltform and it makes sense to improve the design of auto's. FWD is a thing of the past I would bet by 2010. RWD with traction control is great for 60% of the country and the rest will be offered AWD or ATEESA type systems.

The argument that FWD is a good decision isn't invalidated yet neither can you say that it's hype that gets people demanding RWD cars. Balance is not just weight distribution..it's also which way the weight shift when you floor it. RWD is not bad - in fact it's merit's, I believe, and not hype got it on the comeback trail.

Specifically the 3-series though. It's ironic above $40K there is not a lot of competition in the FWD space. Aside from the Acura RL, what other vehicle is FWD?

Change PA to NY or NJ and here's my take. The handling will be compromised at best without snow tires. This applies to any RWD vehicle. Preferably 4 good snows will make a big difference."
367,"January 6, 2004 8:57AM",qbrozen,"chrisboth - FWD is a thing of the past...
since it is cheaper for manufacturers to use FWD and serves to make smaller and lighter cars (which translates to better gas mileage), then, no, you won't see that happen. But, if I were to entertain your idea for a moment and throw away all benefits to a manufacturer, I'd have to say BOTH RWD and FWD will be in the past and everything will be AWD.

As far as the RWD vs. FWD, I'd like to do as I say above and jump on the side of AWD! If its good enough for some top supercars and exotics, its good enough for me!"

AWD does add weight, lower fuel efficiency and compromise handling. The trade-off is the ability to handle torque with the loss of balance posed by the additional hardware. But to some the trade-off is worth it."

Given 2 identical cars in every other way accept drivetrain configuration, the extra weight of AWD will most likely lose, but, again, on a dry course.

The new to be E60 M5 3.9 to 60 RWD. You don't need AWD to do it. It's just another option, just like FWD. But it does add extra weight, reduce gas mileage. Sure manufacturers have used it to lay power down 4 wheels at a time."

When looking at test results, you have to look at what track, track conditions, drivers, tires, methodology, etc.

Keep in mind that F1, NASCAR, etc. all have arbitrary rules. NASCAR uses live axles and carburetors (I can't hardly spell this archaic word). Much more powerful F1 cars have various restrictions on engine size, etc. F1 cars in early 1980s put out 1,200 HP. Today they are more like 900 or so HP.

I'm fairly certain I would have passed on a 330i with AWD. I don't like the understeer then neutral then oversteer drive feel of an AWD car. My friend's WRX is a fun, highly modded car but the AWD system makes me VERY happy to get back into my RWD 330i.

380,"January 6, 2004 5:47PM",saugatak,"I agree that a well built well designed performance car with RWD is the best handling sedan out there ON NON-SNOWY ROADS.

In 2002 in the Northeast when there were a lot of snowstorms, RWD cars without snowtires got stuck on the road. If my ride were a BMW 330 (not an all wheel drive), I'd have to buy at least 2 snow tires for the rear wheels and hang on to them. Then I'd have to go to the mechanic to get them installed before the snowstorm hits.

Oh no, everyone else is on line doing the same thing and the mechanic can't get to me, too bad. Now I'm stuck on snow roads with regular tires in a RWD car. Oh damn, now I just got stuck and have to walk home in 2 foot snow while getting snowsprayed by all the FWD cars going through no problem. Or better yet, I just spun out but before I crashed I was thinking ""Well this is a small price to pay for having a RWD performance car.""

In NY, I drive a FWD car out of choice b/c I have gotten stuck in snow in RWD cars, but I have never gotten stuck in a FWD car. And yes, I did have an AWD Audi but the extra weight on the car made the car really slow and a gas hog.

And what happens if I trade in the car and it uses different size tires? Now I have to get new snow tires and try to sell the old ones. Good luck getting value for those old snow tires.

In sum, RWD in a good performance car gives best performance but that don't mean much in snow.

AWD gives best snow performance but on dry roads it's slower, the heavier weight of the car affects its turning ability and when you have to do a lot of turning the software on the AWD system gets confused so the car acts schizophrenic.

FWD doesn't give as good a performance in snow as AWD, but it's usually good enough and its performance on dry roads is second to RWD but better than AWD, and it usually has the best gas mileage.

I think that manufacturers will continue to make FWD, RWD and AWD cars to suit different tastes and climates. Since the CamCord are the best selling cars and they're FWD (plus they show no signs of giving up the sales crown), I disagree with your contention that FWD cars are a thing of the past."

...as they put it, most of their favorite V6 family sedans like the Accord, Camry, and Passat ""scored higher in our tests than most of the vehicles in this category, and they cost about $3,000 to $9,000 less.""

If you want to see how the 330i and IS300 stack up, you have to pull out the May 2001 issue of CR.

Speaking of tires...

330i was non-Sport Pkg and rode on 205/50R17 93V (mediocre) Continental ContiTouringContact tires.

TL rode on Bridgestone Turanza EL42 P235/45R17 93W tires.

IS300 rode on Goodyear Eagle GS-D 215/45ZR17 87W tires.

For those who love numbers, with each being tested with an automatic transmission...

60-0 mph dry braking: IS300 128 ft, TL 130 ft, and 330i 131 ft

Avoidance maneuver: IS300 57 mph, 330i 55.5 mph, and TL 52.5 mph

0-60 mph: 330i 6.6 secs, TL 6.7 secs, and IS300 7.4 secs

45-65 mph: TL 4.2 secs, IS300 4.4 secs, and 330i 5.3 secs

1/4 mile: 330i 15.1 secs, TL 15.2 secs, and IS300 15.7 secs

CR clearly points out that the TL cannot handle like the 330i or IS300.

Overall fuel economy: TL 23 mpg, 330i 22 mpg, and IS300 21 mpg

Predicted reliability: IS300 best rating with TL and 330i getting next best rating (in original test). In today's data, IS300 retains best rating and 330i has fallen to only average reliability.

Interesting that of the 15 cars in their ""upscale sedan category"", the FWDers finished 1st, 4th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 14th, and 15th. The RWDers finished 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 8th, and 12th. The AWDers finished 7th and 13th. Say the RWDers win this one."
382,"January 6, 2004 6:50PM",fedlawman,"The TL's biggest handicap vs. the IS300 and 330i isn't its drivetrain, it's curb weight."
383,"January 6, 2004 6:56PM",riez,"FWD is inherently front heavy. And it asks the drive wheels to steer. FWD cannot overcome the laws of physics. Which is one reason there is no FWD supercar.

A FWDer and RWDer of the same total weight will NOT have that weight evenly distributed. That weight distribution penalty causes an inherent disadvantage.

And since the best tires can go on any vehicle, the FWDer cannot overcome its limitations by using better rubber."

riez, I think we all agree that tires men a lot when it comes to handling.
Here is some stats. for you:

Bridgestone Turanza EL42 P235/45R17 93W : handling rating - 5.80, dry traction - 6.30, wet traction - 5.1
Goodyear Eagle GS-D 215/45ZR17 87W tires: handling rating - 8.80, dry traction - 9.20, wet traction - 9.10
ContiTouringContact 205/50R17 93V tires: handling rating - 8.30, dry traction - 8.70, wet traction - 7.7

The number are based on 10 point system and taken from tire rack.

As you can see TL has the worse tires by far. This is why TL scored marginally lover in handling and accelerations tests, plus as somebody mentioned TL is also heavier.

With that said , if you put the same tires on all three vehicles you will get almost identical numbers in handling."

Do keep in mind that you have to pay careful attention to the test methodology. If you study the fine print of R&T, MT, and C&D, you'll see how they do theirs. Tells how they achieve maximum 0-60 mph times (e.g., high RPM drop clutch) and whether they publish actual results (what they did that day on that track at that altitude at that temperature) or adjusted results (mathematically altering the data for temperature, etc.). Thinking C&D and MT publish adjusted results and R&T publishes actual results. Also thinking R&T discusses how results within a certain range are essentially statistically not different.

Do you happen to know the DOT grades (temperature, wear, and traction) for each of these tires?

The ContiTouringContacts are NOT a performance tire. Continental ContiSportContacts and ContiSportContact 2s are Continentals highest performing tires. My wife's '00 323ia had the Tourings; I put a set of SportContact 2s on my '98 540i6. World of difference.

CR's 330i would have handled and braked much better if it had had the optional Sport Pkg, which it did not. The Sport Pkg provides improved suspension setting and better tires (e.g., a tire like the SportContact)."

Tire width means bigger contact patch. All other things equal, a wider tire should improve braking and (most) handling-related numbers.

The 3 series redesign is now a few years old, to have every other magazine, still note it's the benchmark except for one, says mountains about the car. Do you think the Acura will remain on the top for 4 years in a row?

What is the difference? Value should, by definition, take all aspects of the purchase into account, including capabilities. Weighing the capabilities and content against the cost equates the value.

Actually, the $7K to get from the Accord to the TL doesn't get you $7K worth of benefit toward the Bimmer.

My point is that in the real world RWD has its limitations. In cases of snow, FWD has the advantage. As for AWD SUVs, that's the biggest joke. You would not believe how many SUVs get towed out of snow banks and ditches in Toronto after a snow storm -- way too many. I've been driving FWDs in snow for 14 years and never, ever got stuck.

If I can't do that, I'd rather drive the Bimmer. Anyway since we're talking about unused capabilities, why don't you drive a Honda Accord and save yourself $7K, if you are sitting in traffic. You have unused capabilities, especially with the inbound Toronto traffic in the morning.$4K for a good aftermarket stereo along with a Honda could still save you money over a TL."

They owners are a joke. FWD is not as capable as AWD there can't be argument here can there be...? Perhaps the AWD owners should learn how to drive and recognize that AWD doesn't make for better stopping.

While FW is almost as good as all wheel it is not better.

And I see tons of SUV's that people in CO seem to put off road in snow banks and medians all the time - THEY ARE ALL 4 WHEEL DRIVE NOT AWD...huge difference. People dont go into 4wd when they should and leave it 2 wheels usually rear."

TL has a great interior - one of the best. But the car is not a top line sports sedan by virtue of the limitations that several editors and testers have all consistently harped it for. FWD. There is little else to know once these facts are revealed to RWD fans. Its on deaf ears."
419,"January 7, 2004 3:56PM",qbrozen,"No, sorry, I have no idea what you mean.

but, honestly, i'm not trying to knock anyone's choice. I'm just trying to defend what I found to be a great car (referring to the TL). And if the only advantage that can be stated for buying the BMW over the TL is that extra .5 G of roadholding ability, that's just not going to pursuade me to fork over all that extra money. And, according to C&D, even the Accord coupe you are fond of mentioning is faster in the quarter mile than the 330 with performance pack.

But there is so much more to consider aside from numbers. The TL is quieter, quicker, better handling, more solid, better shifter, better clutch, better interior materials, etc. over the Accord. I can't say all that regarding the BMW."
420,"January 7, 2004 3:56PM",saugatak,"there is nothing wrong with you having and enjoying your RWD car for non-snow occasions and getting an AWD SUV for snowy occasions.

it's your money and it's your choice how to spend it.

as someone currently living in NYC and paying close to $400 a month in garage fees, i'd be paying nearly $5k a year in parking fees alone to be able to do what you're doing.

i frankly don't enjoy the advantages of RWD so much that i'll pay the extra in parking fees so i choose to go with FWD.

your categorical statement ""There is little else to know once these facts are revealed to RWD fans. Its on deaf ears."" is just plain wrong. people have needs, budgets, space limitations plus a desire to simplify one's life (something to be said for not having to worry about maintenance, insurance, registration, etc. for another car when you can only drive one at a time).

seems like a big waste to have 2 cars for yourself when you can get by with one, but i realize my personal minimalist philosophy of trying not to clutter your life with too many things is not for everyone.

Think we can all agree that the 325i and 330i are highly related. And that the Accord V6 sedan and TL are highly related. (Heck, for that matter, the TSX is the European Accord.)

If all you worry about is a boring commute, save money and buy an inexpensive car or maybe a used car.

But if driving pleasure is your goal, then just any old car won't do.

I think we all agree that performance is marginally better, or I should say handling, so I 'll give this to 330(just to make you happy)

Styling is in the eyes of the beholder , you like 330 better others dont, I like both equally(330 better exterior, TL better interior), so lit say it's a tie.

Value goes hands down to TL, I think most us will agree, I think you can't include handling, because you already got a point for performance.

I would also give TL a point for features, but I'm not gona because it's part of the value.

Price I think all agree TL gets the point.

Cost to lease will go to TL. Lease for a none nav TL about $420-$450 including tax and maybe another $1,500 for all fees, total - $17,700 plus oil change $400= $18,100.
330 (performance pakg) lease is close to $550-$600 including tax plus fees $1,500 = $23,100.

So I say TL is a winner.

As for me if I could have lease loaded 330 for the same money as TL, I would do it, but it is at least $100 more a month."

No I meant performance.

Cost to lease...tie...you can get that down to about $500-520 making it about $19K or so. For a car that's 10 grand more paying a few dollars more isn't a big deal. BTW I'm paying just slightly more than $18K for mine. Just want to know that a fabulous deal, cause friend who has a 2003 TL is paying way more than that. Almost as much as my Bimmer.

Goodies - TL

Styling is inherently subjective. The CTS, TL and Maxima are all way too angularly styled for my taste. Trying to be overly modern. The 3 Series is tasteful but a bit bland. I think the IS300 is the best balance of tasteful and modern.

As for goodies, IS300 has a ton, including the most important of all: LSD! 3 Series can only be had with LSD in M3 version."
445,"January 8, 2004 6:16AM",riez,"cybersol... CR ranks the G35 12th out of the 15 cars in their upscale sedan category. CR's full test of the G35 sedan was in the July 2003 issue. In that test it came out fourth behind the Lincoln LS6, Cadillac CTS, and Nissan Maxima 3.5 SE, but ahead of the Saab 9-3 Vector.

They tested a G35 automatic. Test data:

Dry braking, 60-0 mph: 133 ft
Avoidance maneuver: 54.0 mph
0-60 mph: 6.8 secs
1/4 mile: 15.4 secs
45-65 mph: 4.3 secs
Fuel economy: 20 mpg

Tires: Bridgestone Turanza EL42, P215/55R17 93V. So, again, pretty narrow tires compared to TL's 235s.

Predicted reliability: 2nd best rating."
446,"January 8, 2004 6:33AM",chrisboth,Notice the above time is the worst ever published for the sedan. I'd take my grounding wired G35 against a TL and feel pretty confident I'd tie or better 50% of the time. 6.8 is bad. The 5AT records 6.2 and the 6MT is approx 5.5-5.9. 45-65 tells all about the power of the these motors. Anyone care to put up those numbers comparing TL/3/IS...
447,"January 8, 2004 6:47AM",riez,"Remember to take into account equipment on the tested car. The BMW 330i was NOT tested with its most valuable Sport Package. Don't believe the G35 had its either. So they ran on terrible tires.

Also, you have to take into account CR's methodology. Compare that to methodology of car magazines. Auto press usually uses whatever most aggressive method at launch.

And remember that CR does NOT get its cars from the manufacturers. It buys real cars off real dealers' lots. Is easy for manufacturers to give car magazines ringers!"
448,"January 8, 2004 7:14AM",kdshapiro,"The Ultimate Argument does not hold water. Performance figures do not indicate a 330i will be seeing the taillights of any car in this category. The cars the 330i will see the taillights of so will the TL and G35. Since I have no plans on racing you on the street and potentially hurting myself or other drivers, I will have to leave it to people who measure such things.

Even with CRs testing methodolody, G35 came in behind 330i. It's not about the 330i being faster, it's about the 330i being the more expensive, holding it's own against cars having bigger engines, with a 35 hp/torque advantage. And while the 330i may lose the quarter mile to a G35, it loses by .1 second to a car with a .5 liter bigger engine.

riez - I believe is correct, that car mags use a do-or-die method to get the absolute fastest time. You wouldn't necessarily want to do that to your car. CR probably uses a more conservative approach, where drivetrain parts do not get strewn all over the tarmac.

Not knocking either car, you can't dismiss the performance/handling aspect of the 3-series, while extolling the value aspect of either car.

You G35, TL & IS300 worshipers are gonna be upset when the new 2005 Legacy finally hits the shores. Performance and handling will leave those behind.

As for fuel economy, despite technological advancement, performance and economy are fundamentally opposite objectives. And gas is cheap compared to the total cost of this class of cars.

As an owner of none of these, but a long time shopper, my opinion on the best for each function.

Exterior Design: All good, all different
Interior Design: A4, TL, C-Class
Size/Space: G35 and TL
Acceleration: BMW, G35, TL
Braking: all very similar
Handling: BMW, G35, IS300
Cost: Similar except the 330i, C-Class cost more
Reliability: Japanese better than European

For me personally, Acceleration, Handling, Size, and Cost are more important than the interior, so if I were shopping for a sedan it would lead me to the G35.

But I am looking for a convertible, and I can't have a manual because my significant other will not budge on that issue. All that leads me to a 330Cic with SMG.

476,"January 8, 2004 5:31PM",riez,"chrisboth & kahunah... What percentage of long-term ownership costs do you think are related to fuel? Not much. Depreciation is the biggest hit. Don't forget about insurance. TTL. Annual registration. Maintenance, including tires.

I paid about $30,000 for the car. I'm getting about 25-26 mpg. If I drive 100,000 miles over 6 years that will take about 3,922 gallons of fuel (at 25.5 avg.mpg). In my town right now premium (Amoco/BP Ultimate, the only fuel I use) costs about $1.63 per gallon. That would be a mere $6,393 in total fuel costs. My car insurance over the same time would be about $7,200. The intitial tax on the car was around $1,500. In the first five years of ownership, it will cost me about $1,950 just to register the car ($325 per year). Four sets of tires will cost me at least $1,600 (at just $100 per tire). And what will depreciation be over this 100k/6 years? Probably about $20-24,000.

So that $6,393 in fuel isn't a big consideration. Say I got 30 mpg. That would be 3,333 gallons for $5,433. Or a mere $960. $160 per year. Or just $.0096 per mile driven. Is this a big deal? Not even a penny a mile.

485,"January 9, 2004 3:34AM",cybersol,"Well, first of all, horsepower has little to do with acceleration, its all about top speed. Acceleration is about torque, and not just peak torque, but the whole area under the torque curve. The TL achieves 238 lb.ft. @ 5000 rpm while the BMW achieves 214 lb.ft. @ 3500 rpm. So there is only 24 lb. ft. of difference in the peak torque, but the bmw acheives it much earlier. An earlier torque peak generally means a much broader and flatter torque curve in general (less peaky). It also generally means less peak hp, which explains the large hp difference.

And second of all, the engine is not alone, power is tramsitted to the ground via the gearing of the transmission and the final drive axle. Gear spacing affects acceleration by allowing the engine to stay longer between its peak torque and peak hp. The first gear ratio also needs to be selected so as to deliver maximum power without overpowering the wheels and tires that will deliver the force to the ground.

All that being said, I listed the BMW, G35, and TL because they are approximately equal in all the acceleration testing I have seen. There seems to be just as large a variation in the times of different G35s, for instance, as there is a variation between the three different models."
486,"January 9, 2004 6:02AM",riez,"The RX is based on the Camry.

The IS300's ""lowish"" highway fuel economy estimate is due to its gearing. It does not use a very deep overdrive 5th gear. I'd prefer a deeper overdrive, but you hardly have to shift out of 5th in order to pass. The IS300 is performance car, not an economy car. Designed for drivers who even want performance in 5th gear?

Just compare the gearing in the Camry and RX versus the IS300 (taking into account both final drive ratio and the individual ratio of each gear).

If you want to complain, check out the mileage differences between the 325i and 330i. The less powerful 325i isn't very fuel efficient. And part of that problem is tied to its gearing (as well as a smallish engine for the car's weight)."

Isn't that the point. It doesn't matter for example, why people don't understand why BMW sells boat loads of their 3-series, just that they do. However, in the pursuit of automotive excellence the press provides a function in determining in a more unbiased fashion, than you or I debating the merits of a particular vehicle or aspect of a vehicle.

The reason I posted that information, is to show in contrary to some other opinions that the 3-series is a has-been, the automotive press still regards it as a benchmark in the world of entry level luxury sport sedans. This is not in one magazines opinions, but others as well. Looking at automotive opinions is just one way of level setting the conversation.

Now you could go say you don't believe that vehicle is for you or that it doesn't have any value to you, or other vehicles do some aspects in the world of sports sedans better. I would more than agree. But you can't discuss sports or sporty sedans, while ignoring the obvious, which is the overall handling and not focus on one set of numbers."
516,"January 25, 2004 11:47AM",riez,"Pretty much anytime the automotive press (rightly) touts the 3 Series, they normally are talking about either the M3 (a most awesome car!) or non-M cars with (1) manual transmission and (2) Sport Package.

A 325i automatic without Sport Pkg is a rather expensive and somewhat mundane car. There is really nothing unique about it other than the marque badging. But it lacks those critical features (1) and (2) that create the ""difference between what is simply good and what is genuinely excellent.""

If you LOVE to drive there is only one way to get a 3 Series: Sport Package and manual transmission. All the others are pretenders as serious all around sport sedans.

And IF BMW was so serious about the love of driving and creating the true existential difference between good and excellent, where is LSD??? That speaks volumes. Only M3 and M5 have LSD. Does BMW think the other buyers aren't smart enough to figure it out? Or do they know something about their buyers that we don't?

But guess what percentage of 3 Series, esp. sedans, are sold with automatics? Bet it is at least 60 percent. And what percentage of 3 Series sedans have Sport Package? Doubt it is over 25 percent. And what percentage of sedans are both manual transmission and Sport Package? Doubt it is over 15 percent.

The FM platform has been recently compared to the GT-3 porsche...and often compared to the 5 series...who really is worried if the everyman 3 driving public gives credence to the car that actually performs better than the 3 the 5 the boxster the audi a4 and a6 the mercedes 320 in any model and........."

The BMW is still more than being merely competitive, even with less power. Are you saying the 3 is no longer the benchmark and that MB, Audi, Jaguar and others are studying the G35 now?

Despite my fascination with German cars, the G35 Coupe is a strong contender for my next car, but the interior is downright cheap for this class of car. Whether or not it's trying to be different is open for debate, but that still doesn't mean it has to be cheap feeling/looking.

The tourque peak is at around 4 - did you actually drive it. The end of the fun is around 6k if you look at the curve and actually drive one it;s quite apparent. Lets not forget the TL v G 1/4 mile and 0-100 numbers....

At 4 grand with WOT the G IS as fast as an M3 until 6K This does not make it a better car than an M3. The bang for buck is exactly where you say it isn't in the G. When you go for another drive notice it has almost a turbo lag until about 3200 rmp - and then thrust city. Your statement is quite absurd IMO. At 4k the thing is worth BMW money and I may have paid it.

Take a look at torque numbers per litre for each. While you are waiting to come alive I've been thrusting down the pike and showing you my led's!

""Are you saying the 3 is no longer the benchmark and that MB, Audi, Jaguar and others are studying the G35 now?

I doubt the germans will ever emulate the japanese - too bad for many reasons too but I am saying the G35 is teh benchmark now. Look at the New GS lexus shows at the detriot show I believe for 2006. Looks like the G has had an impact for the next generation in design. Did you see the rear quarter - they may get sued.

Look at the numbers look at the design and the reliablity. Hell if you dont like the interior as much as i love my willow leather and titanium then wait 12 months and see what happens. The benchmark should not lose to a first timer in performance, be smaller and cost more while in the same class and be considered anything but playing catch up ala the 3.8i v8 3 series coming soon (with a G competitive price too).

Is there that much of a difference in G over three - NO NO NO. It's simply my argument that that 3 being a benchmark is yesterdays hype still rolling with powerful marketing intertia. The 3 is great no G owner want to take that away from anyone...it's just not the only one anymore and not the best by the performance numbers. If there is something else besides great numbers and looks to pay for I'm not sure I'm going to pay BMW prices for it. I think some people just like that germanic intangible - you get it in a Golf too and to me it conjures up reliabillity issues that seem to pervade every german automaker relentelessly and consistenly. See Bllueguys comments as a 3 owner.

Also the benchmark should not be overlooked by a comepitors cross shopping as the 3 is when G cross shopppers look at the 5 as an alternative.

I'd say the 5 is the benchmark the G strives to become over the next five years and the 3 becomes more inline with the is-300 and accord and saab. Is it pricing or size that matters when class comparing?

The data above is from the Edmunds 2003 sedan comparison test. I apologize for the formatting but it was a copy and paste.
My point here is that sometimes we get overly enthusiastic about what we own and start quoting what we believe to be true in terms of performance, etc. All of these are fine cars and we all have different reasons for buying them.
These are 2003 models. The TL stats have improved for the TL because of the new model. I believe the 330i and the G35 are consistent with the 2004 models as they are running the same motors as 2003 in 2004 ?
The recent Edmunds test for the 04 TL had 0-60 in 6.5 and 1/4 mile in 14.9. G35 for 2004 was 0-60 in 6.1 and 1/4 mile in 14.7. I know the 330i 0-60 was almost identical to the TL. There were some 5.7 times reported for both in recent articles.
The 2003 comparison showed the 330i with the fastest 0-60 time of 6.3. You can find different reviews of these cars with different 0-60 and 1/4 mile times. I believe this is explained by track conditions, tires and skill of the individuals doing the driving. The bottom line for me is that I think you can throw a blanket over these cars in terms of performance in a straight line. It will depend on who is at the wheel. I guess I am disputing the post above which states everyone else will be seeing the LED's of the G 35.
A really interesting part of the test which I had not seen before was the run through the 600 ft slalom course. The 330i won by edging out the A4 and both of these were 2 mph faster than the others. The G35 was last. I don't know if the G35 made changes to suspension or tires for 04.
I just re read the Edmunds test for the 04 TL and the TL went through at 67 mph this year. Quite an improvement from the 03 TL-s 61.3 mph. Edmunds said it was ""one of the fastest cars we've ever taken through the cones"". As a TL owner it shows me that perhaps the rhetoric I constantly hear about RWD being much better handling isn't necessarily true in all instances.
I am looking forward to the ""shoot out"" articles that are surely coming in the auto mags. At least it frames the conversations in facts and data and away from opinion."
545,"January 27, 2004 10:17AM",kdshapiro,"raher - just to cite an example. Cars improve every year, so it would be no surprise a FWD of 1980 would be bested by a FWD of 2004. However, having said that, I would like to see how the new ZHP stacks up with the G35 with the SP against the new TL. In the same comparo. Chances are they will best the FWD because of the weight distribution.

It is my belief that the average driver can get more out of a FWD than a RWD. But a RWD driver who has taken performance classes can extract more out of the RWD than a skilled driver can extract out of the FWD.

So to your point, there are advantages and disadvantages of each."

So yes, cars like the mini will shine in certain situations due to it's overall small chassis, which is aided by the fact FWD has a smaller footprint. But they are inhertently hp limited.

In 99% of every comparison I have ever read apples to apples, the 0-100 and the quarter mile went to the G - that says alot. 0-60 can go to anyone on any given day but the real fun and where my purchase decision was made is winding out 3rd..that is well past 60 mph and where my engine and platform shine and seemingly pull away from all competition. I've seen it on the street and I've seen it in the mags. The G pulls hard and leaves many in awe in 3rd gear (i have 5at).

""As a TL owner it shows me that perhaps the rhetoric I constantly hear about RWD being much better handling isn't necessarily true in all instances.""

No not in all instances but many still. 67 is great for a FWD'er. But since you quote edmunds above here are some other quotes - KDS will enjoy this..""For me, if I'm after a truly sporty sedan, I have to go with the BMW 3 Series"" That is from the editor in cheef after testing the new TL.

Since FWD is for many more than RWD this car should be fine for those folks - there are some more discerning sprts sedan drivers who will avoid this myself included. Driving dynamics are a serious issue in my book and only RWD covers all the performance bases. FWD is too compromising and the reason in the article are stated up front. They are physical laws that cannot be avoided even by japansese engineers at Honda.

There were other comments on edmunds that the TL is great as long as you dont drive an accord first and get a taste of the platform with about the right amount of power and all the great reason to buy an acura but for alot less.

And again, why should the G without SP upgrades be compared to 3 with upgrades. I still will take my chances in 5AT form against one on track and god knows i would in 6MT form. Lets see the G35 with a performance package and then we'll compare again.

Someone mentioned the G was shooting for the stars...dam right and getting there quickly - this is year #2 folks and 5 series has been here for how long. Keep in mind that at 3900 pounds the and similarly sized as G the G is much faster and equally as fast as the 540i.

551,"January 27, 2004 11:14AM",raher,"The main point of my post was to emphasize that enthusiasm for the cars we own often clouds reality and opinion is stated as fact. Edmunds didn't say their slalom test result for the TL was good for a FWD car..they said it was one of the fastest they had ever tested.. period. As to race track performance, one of the previous posts said it best...3 series and Integra battle it out for championships in SCCA racing in that class. Your opinion of the G35 is no substitute for facts. Stating that in 99% of the tests you have seen the G35 wins 0-60 and 0-100 doesn't mean anything unless you have an example.
What tests , where. I am sure the G35 has come out on top in some tests just as the 330i has and the TL. I stand by my original statement..you can throw a blanket over them for straight line performance. The differences are in 1/10's of a second. Having gearing that emphasizes torque or speed in 3rd versus 2nd or 4th doesn't matter if you are measuring 0-60 or 0-100 since elapsed time is what is being measured.
Gearing is more important on a race track since the car has to be set up to maximize speed within the confines of the circuit. Having a 160 mph top speed doesn't get you much if the straight only allows 140 mph top end.
I know the G35 is a great car. I would have bought the coupe but my wife couldn't live with two doors. That doesn't mean it is the end all $30K to $40K sedan however as you keep insisting in your posts."

The TL-S is much different than the new TL in gearing and motor and weight and CD. I think I'd expect the results you described for your car. Do you have an auto? Read the stats - none of the 04 cars mentioned (545 notwithstanding) are going to be THAT different really. My points about the G are in context of being the new benchmark as opposed to the 3. These differences are not very big but I will suggest they are consistent and in one direction.

That said I would expect the new TL to hang with a 540 pretty well. 6.2 is the 0-60 on 540 right guys?"

566,"January 27, 2004 12:44PM",raher,"chris..it appears to me you are the one posting that the G can't be beat but don't have any facts to back it up other than it is your opinion because you really like your car. Everyone gets left behind by someone. I am still not convinced that the G is going to consistently leave the other sedans behind since the data isn't out there yet to back up your opinion. That's what those multi car shootouts do. What will you do when you eventually lose one of those stoplight races because your reaction time was a little slow ? Yell at them that the G 35 is faster but the driver isn't ? There really isn't any point to continue to chant the G 35 mantra since you are the only one who appears to believe it. I am willing to admit that they are all nice cars and have different strengths and weaknesses. I am not willing to admit that any of the sedans being discussed is a clear cut winner over the others.
As to the VQ being the most ""respected"" engine in the $30K class...respected by who..the owner of the car ? Respect isn't something I give to inanimate objects, respect is for people.

If the car was slower by more than .2 seconds or handled less - I'd buy that swamp sale. Get over the manual tranny thing - it's old school now that SMG 8 and 9 speeds are on the drawing boards. Personally I hope that I'll always have the choice to go to personally engaging the clutch or not. You are preaching to someone who used to think that way...as far as troucning me - you'll have to be a much better driver and in our hypothetical world these cars are very even. 0-60 you can have if I can have 0-100.

0-60 is not a race - you can have your gearing designed to compete directly with the G and then I can get past you to 100 just like the stats show.

If someone needs me to prove it to them then I'll I have to do is simply READ BACK at all the freaking comps posted already - take a look at each one specifying a 0-100 and quarter. Find any car in class that beats G auto to auto or 6 to 6 and I will concede to you whatever you want. I've been there before and I thought most of you were already there with me.

The G interior was purposefully not too posh - rather industrial and not trying to be BMW while beating the 330i - killing the auto 330i in any timed run, outhandling the 330i, mathcing the 330zhp in handling, beating the 530 matching the 540..and I CAN compare the 5 - the luxury goodies aside the cars have VERY similar sized wheelbases, and displacement.

The G is faster, despite most automotive magazines opinion that they are at least in the same ballpark. The G can be directly compared to the new 5 series, due to the wheelbase.

Lets remember the original statement that got it all started to put it back into context. I am hypothesizing that BMW 3 is no longer the benchmark or the standard based on performance and ""automotive press"". Again: The differences as agreed to be minute but the whole argument you have made for a year now or more is that BMW holds the class trophy for sports sedan superiority and nothing comes close. I say based on nothing real anymore ~ your just used to saying it and rightfully so until 2002.

THings changed when the japanese stopped putting G20's out there and called them 3 beaters. You 3ers got used to having no competition - it doesn't suck for the consumer whose a fan of any competitor.

""A 540i automatic driven by someone with poor skills maybe"" I'm sure it was an auto and I'm sure the poor guy just pressed on the gas real hard and his skills didn't get in the way too bad. Check another stat on the G and compare - 50-70 and 5-60 numbers are very good for the Z car platform. You guys may find value in many things about many cars - I find value in the thrust and handling that no other car can best in class.

Let's compare a Cayenne Twin-turbo with a G or Z"" This vehicle can dust both of these. On the track/street and off-road. Since it seems not to matter what we are comparing to the G, how much it cost or how much it weighs, let's us this vehicle as a benchmark. Or better yet, let's use an M5 or even an M3, or even a ZHP. Wait, let's even use the new Acura 2004 TL. Since the G/Z platform compares favorably in price, handling, speed, acceleration to every single vehicle, FWD/RWD/NA and forced-air.

""The z has been compared to the GT3 ""

Show me where chris. A vehicle that can go to 60 in under 4 seconds with a top speed of over 200 mph, has been compared to a vehicle that can get to 60 in about 5.5 slower than an WRX/EVO with a lower top speed than a WRX/EVO, has been compared to a GT3? OK. Doesn't make sense to me. But if someone said it, it's gotta be the case. I read somewhere the ZHP has been compared to the Bugatti, wow am I impressed at BMW for producing a vehicle that gets mentioned in the same breath as a 1000 hp vehicle."

I'm sure they didn't mean in a straight line, because Nismoed Z is not any more powerful than regular Z. But they meant on a racetrack.

The point is it wasn't said about any vehicle, currently on sale in the US. Not future vehicles, but current vehicles. This is an important point that wasn't communicated in the post.

Correct, with mods ala M. Adding a supercharger to the M3, ZHP, with suspension upgrades, would get a commesurate increase in power/handling capabilities as well. Maybe that's why BMW doesn't offer performance upgrades, it wants you to buy their cars. But Nissan needs to compete, because it only has one model. Acura has is R-spec(A-spec) with 300hp. Everybody's doing it."
594,"January 28, 2004 9:04AM",chrisboth,"""Correct, with mods ala M""

What? The mods are suspension only in the GT3 comparison! The platforms, horsepower notwithstanding, are the basis for the argument that the 3 is now bested.

It's not a stretch to see why when you look at the global accolades this platform gets. I'd take plain z and a carrera to the track anyday and take my chances in either. That car shares 90% of underpinnings with G. The engine HP wars don't mean a dam thing here you are changing the subject. The platforms being compared are in the same class and the accolades falling on the G and her cousins are telling - with non M type of upgrades KD.

As for the A-spec - still FWD - still low torque - its only another 30hp - another 30 over the accord's that make it 60 too many. I bet those fat sweet tires will help - what are those 295/21's??"
595,"January 28, 2004 9:16AM",biggie2,"Why is everyone so worried about if the G is a tad bit better than the 3 series?

Simple truth is, the G or Z will never reach the pinacle of true vehicle perfection that the 3 once had. Nothing could touch it for four or so years there. The 3 series is an old car, the G is much newer. The fact that the 3 series kept atop the extremely competitive automobile industry for so long is a testament to just how good this car really is. As long as BMW doesnt screw this car up, i am sure the next 3 series will blow every competing vehicle away once again.

I personally feel that the advantages of having a G35 over a 3 series is one: price, and two: having a much more rare car. I hardly ever get to see a G, while i probably see two 3 series everytime i go out."

Thanks chris for your help. Let's compare a drag racer against the Z and see who wins. Seems like you like to bring everything into the mix, even though you can't buy it and ride down the street with it. Heck in 2007 I may even be brave enough to go over to the Nissan/Infiniti side of the house. I'm not proud, if BMW can't do it, someone else can. A RWD Acura and better branded RWD Lexus, if done properly, would trounce the Z on the Japan Inc playing field. I hope Nissan is watching, because Lexus knows how to do it and has the cash. That is really the car I want to own, a Lexus ""branded"" BMW, I won't mind paying a premium for it either."

Not a lot of toyota R&D goes into FM type platforms or Sports cars. IT's all subject to change im sure.

Now you are comparing to cars that don't exist yet...by the time those come off the drawing board - nissan will have the GTR out and and M45. But if there's something out there that rocks the auto world like the G I'll be the first in line. I love a benchmark blaster - bring me more!"

Correct. That's why some people I know instead of buying Lexus, Infiniti, BMW buy Hyundai. Present value of $25,000 for 10 years is what? You don't have to skip buying a 540 to save money, you can skip buying Infiniti also and save a bundle. At the end, buy that M5 for cash.

Come on chris - People who are really serious about saving money, don't even buy cars over $10/$11K, much less buying a BMW or Infiniti."

You can buy any car which suited you best, compare all the goodness and the bad and get the best value of it.

Some people prefer the best brand name in the market, some people like one of the best brand name and others just doesnt care about brand. Best brand name does not always come with more features, more luxury, better performance etc. Besides there is no absolute answer for which brand is actually the best.

They just caught up with the market by making one car G35(Z350), don't forget this is the only car that worth talking, everything else Infiniti builds is a bust.. G35 is not better performance car than 3 series and does not have overall value of TL, I think that infiniti has a long way to go."
606,"January 28, 2004 8:03PM",rderizans,"FWIW, I've read the posts over the last few days with some amusement. What a great world we live in if you've got 30-40k to spend on a car, huh? BMW, Audi, Infiniti, Acura, Caddy...whatever, things just keep getting better, huh?

I just traded my 99 328i (E46) for a G35x. I absolutely loved the 328i, but the ABS pump went and I figured the $2500 repair price was a good excuse to go shopping. Before that, the car was rock-solid. Never a problem, really.

The G35x was just the best value for me out there. It's beautiful (IMHO, of course), has AWD, and a GREAT engine (with more power, but not as smooth-revving as my BMW), while also giving me more room than my BMW. Oh, and it was about $6k less than the comparable 3-series today (330ix), although I don't think the $6k is all prestige - there's definitely something special about a 3.

I test-drove the Acura TL and it's a pretty amazing bargain. Didn't care for the FWD feel or the dealers in my area or I'd probably be driving one today. Interior is AMAZING. Puts Infiniti and BMW to shame. During my test drives, for what it's worth, the engine didn't feel as good as the G35's, but a test drive isn't a great place to evaluate such things. Cars need about several thousand miles on them before the engines loosen up.

Anyway, the BMW (with sport and summer tires)felt lighter and more agile than my new G35x, but the G35x feels more powerful and rides better. Both are awesome cars.

One other note about all of the posted ""tests"" from magazines. I love reading about cars, but the comparos really are sometimes apples to oranges. For example, BMWs are always tested with the sport package and summer tires (usually Pilots). Most other cars are tested with all-season tires. Mention is rarely made of that difference. It certainly must account for some of the skidpad and steering response results. In BMW's defense, they have the guts to put top-flite performance tires on their cars so they should get credit...not like the crap Turanza EL42s that came on my G35x.

Anyhow, my overall point is that after having owned a BMW 3 for over five years and extensively test driving an Audi A4, Acura TL, and G35x, I can say that I honestly think I could have been incredibly happy with any of these four cars. If Caddy can get their build-quality up I'm sure they will be another player. For those who don't think there's something special about a 3-series BMW, you really need to own one for a while. I fell in love and might very well find myself back in a BMW down the line. The g35x is a different and amazing car, though, and for me, it's the best of what's out there today.

Heck, even if you're looking in the 25k range you have the Passat, Mazda6, Accord, Altima, and Camry!

Whatever you choose in whichever class, what a GREAT time to be car shopping!!!"

No problem with the latter part of this, about the G35, but the 540i surely isn't in the G's class, it's several classes above it, and in the hands of a skilled driver the G35 doesn't have a prayer with a 540i.

It really doesn't say much for the G to be compared to the Porsche 928, especially since the car was designed in the seventies. There used to be a website called http://www.4car.co.uk/ and they had all kinds of comparos such as the one you've made here. Before their demise they had a test in which the Audi S6 (Euro model only), XJR (pre 04) and M5 were competing with a used to be untouchable Ferrari, the 512TR, which started out as the Testarossa in the 1980's, and guess what...the M5 beat the Ferrari in every measure. Point being that cars simply advance. I don't know what a 350Z would do other than get humiliated by a 911 GT3. I can mention a SL55 AMG in same breath as an Carrera GT in some areas, bit that doesn't mean the SL55 is comparable overall.

I recognize the 5 is a couple notches higher than the G - but I'm stating that performance alone transcends class which is not based on size and displacement, but on lux items and ride quality. Hey I want an M5 as much as anyone..see some of my past posts. The Edmunds home page today has the G-35 review from archives and it specifically mentions the target as the 540i - as well as the m5.

Whoever suggested infiniti has a long way - hello - FX35 and 45 which are porsche beaters fir 40k less, upcoming m45 - which exists in japan now, things we aren't fortuante enough drive here like the Skylines and GTR's ...There's enough here to keep me happy.

Just because Infiniti mentions the 5-Series and M5 as targets doesn't mean they've met those targets, imo and experience with both cars they've fallen short of a normal 5-Series overall and its too surreal to even think about a G35 competeing with a M5.

I depends, I've always thrown out the JD Powers surveys, even though I have had some vehicles that in the end were super, and in the end were soup.

The answer didn't surprise me. 0.

""Are magazines going to give you the real dirty poop on a car they are paid to advertise?""

I hope they are impartial. That's why I don't based a buying decision on a magazine article. It's just another data point. A first hand reference, others call them anecdotal evidence, means more than the article.

""But you are still getting premium features for your dollars.""

A truer statment was never said.

""But I do think that the Japanese are world class when it comes to reliability through out their lines.""

All in all in my experience out of the 5 in a row Japanese vehicles I owned. 1 I had for 2 years, 1 I had for 12 years, and the other 3 were always going back to the dealer for something or another. I'm glad I got rid of them in 3 years. Actually I'll be glad to get rid of the Bimmer. Can't enjoy it lately. Too much traffic and deteriorating roads make it impossible to drive the car 10 feet without hitting fairly large potholes.

Most urban areas suffer from this and it's getting much worse. Some of the benefits to owning and driving today's advanced luxury performance cars are lost to horrendous road conditions. And yet, some of the automakers are designing more cars as if we all drove on race track like roads every day. Here's a good example taken from a recent Car & Driver road test of the new BMW Z4:

""The one major flaw is the way in which the steering wheel dances wildly in your hands from road undulations. This is the downside of the Z4's newfound handling acumen. The taut tuning and unyielding run-flat tires of the Sport-package car mean every truck trough, pavement cyst, and chuckhole takes a yank at the front wheels and, hence, the steering wheel. Versions with the standard suspension should have less bump steer, but all Z4s come with run-flat tires. Sharp-edged pavement will still send a solid enough thwack through the structure to make you wish you'd swerved around the nasty patch."

I'll agree here. 3-series is loose without SP. I find a much bigger difference with SP on 3-series than on 5-series. Lower CG combined with less weight make the SP difference more pronounced than on 5-series. It becomes more of a sports car than the 5-series could ever hope to be.

Car A for it's bigger engine does not translate into faster 0-60. 330 according to C&D gets to 60 faster than the TL, braking is superior as well. I believe it also beat the TL in the 1/4 mile. The M3 (which is a 3-series after all) for the same size engine as the TL is another story altogether with it's 4.7 0-60. The TL is a great sporty sedan, if you don't mind a little torque steer. The handling of the 330 is just better. Skidpad is better as well. I doubt the TL will best the slalom of the ZHP though, with it's M3 like handling.

FWD cars when driven hard over heat the front tires and start to push more and more. The torque steer requires more driver effort/attention to manage. Anyone who has raced FWD cars has to learn how to manage the tires and the inevitable mid race increase in push. A RWD car takes a lot less effort to drive at speed and puts less load on the front tires.

As so many have pointed out already there is so much more to cars that what can be measured with 0-60 or a 600ft slalom course. If you took 10 highly skilled drivers and asked them which car (TL or 330) they would take for a little 2 hour race (TL vs 330) I would be surprised if any of them choose the TL.

It does make a difference, I think, but much more so on the 325i than the 330i. The suspension on the 330i is the same, regardless of whether you get the sport package or not (it already has the upgraded suspension). The only chassis-related difference is wheels (same 17"" size, though, I think) and, of course, bigger summer performance tires.

The 325i has a softer base suspension.

Don't get me wrong - the BMW sport pkg (seats!)is great (I had a '99 328i that I just traded in a few weeks ago). I'm just saying that it probably doesn't ""transform"" the car as much as people are saying in the case of the 330i or the coupes (which also come standard with the firmer suspension). And, anyone who has driven a 325i without the sport package and claims it ISN'T fun and still dynamically head-and-shoulders above most of the competition hasn't really driven one. It's still a *great* car.

It has long seemed that when the FWD advocates run out of arguments about why their beloved FWD configuration is superior they always turn to how well their cars perform in snow. Hey, y'all had me fooled to the point where I left behind RWD cars in 1979 and didn't start driving them again until 1999. So, I'll start out with a few well chosen words regarding how much better FWD cars perform in snow vs. RWD cars:

1) Assuming the assertion is in fact true, who cares? I mean, how much snow do you really drive in anyway?
2) Sorry guys, it just ain't so.

According to a very interesting test run a couple of years back by one of the car magazines, it is in fact true that under light acceleration, the FWD car will perform better in snow than an otherwise similar RWD car. Unfortunately for the FWD crowd, that's where the performance advantages end. RWD cars, with their naturally better balance (ie. fore/aft weight distribution) reigned supreme in the handling and braking department (AWD cars were a different story, however, the RWD cars, with their lighter relative weight still stopped better). After all, who cares about getting going if you cannot stop or turn?

I am now driving a RWD car with a nearly perfect 50/50 weight distribution, traction control and winter tires, and I can say without a doubt that it is the finest winter weather driving car I have ever driven. Given what Chris Bangle has done to BMW, I have no idea what my next car will be, however, I can assure you that even though I live in snowy New Hampshire, it will be RWD.

739,"February 5, 2004 11:17AM",jrock65,"2004 Estimated 3-year Resale Values (source: ALG)

1) BMW: 54.5%
2) Lexus: 53.2%
3) Acura: 52.1%
4) MB: 52%
5) Audi: 51.2%
6) Infiniti: 51.1%

I got a question. If the average BMW sells for 95% of MSRP, and the average Infiniti sells for 90% of MSRP, aren't real world resale values approximately the same (51.1/90 = 54.5/95 = 57%)?"
740,"February 5, 2004 11:29AM",riez,"jrock65... Those are purely ""guestimates"". The actual numbers won't be know for years when real owners go to sell their cars or trade them in. The industry has done a horrible job projecting depreciation (which impacts both leases and non-lease purchases) for the past decade or more. Trend had been to inflate. Plus manufacturers sometimes artificially inflate residual in order to subsidize the lease. Then they take a bath 3 years down road when their dealers are wholesaling the lease returns.

Realized depreciation really best applies to the person who buys the car new and then sells it later. Their actual realized depreciation is the difference between what they actually paid (which is usually below MSRP) and what they actual get for resale (which is usually below the published books). MSRP is normally meaningless to depreciation unless that is the price paid at time of purchase."
741,"February 5, 2004 11:59AM",jrock65,"Yes, these are estimates, but I don't believe that they're worthless. If I'm buying a car now, there's no way to know for sure what it'll sell for in the future. These estimates do serve as some sort of guide, however imperfect they are.

The tense of my question should be in the future tense."
742,"February 5, 2004 12:03PM",riez,"Guess it really depends on whether you plan on leasing or buying and how long you plan on keeping the car. These guestimates won't matter a whit if you buy the car outright, keep it for a decade, and drive the wheels off of it. Nor will they matter if you are leasing and get a great subsidized lease deal from the manufacturer, where they deliberately over-estimate residuals in order to lower less payment.

Of course, these estimates do matter when it comes to calculating a lease deal today. But I've never leased and can't imagine ever doing so.

But I also think these estimates can be dangerous for people who buy and then plan on trading in or selling off their car in say 2-5 years. These numbers are almost always over what you will actually receive from a dealer or private party. To be safe, deduct at least an extra 10% if not more like 25%.

Give you an example. On 11/30/01 I bought a CPO '98 540i6. Had about 52K miles. Original MSRP was around $58K. I paid about $36K. I traded her in 9/03 at about 78K miles. Got about $19K from dealer. So my actual depreciation for the 22 months and 26K miles I owned her was about $17K. The dealer who bought it from me sold it for about $22K. So the car at 78K miles/5 years was worth a bit over a 1/3 what she went for new/actually paid in '98.

Then they didnt even question this remarkable improvement??

They go on to say that the 330i beats the CLS due to its performance advantage. But when you look at the numbers, they give the CLS a better rating for the engine, a better rating for the transmission and an equal rating for handling.

The fact is TL just had the best sales month in history in Jan, and this is the 3rd gen TL. For a time it was the best selling entry luxury car, and the new one got the record right out of the gate. I'd call that a trend and an exceptionally good start.

769,"February 11, 2004 6:12AM",riez,"mariner7... My only points are (1) SUVs have become a clear trend even in premium marques like BMW and Lexus, (2) there can be intra-marque sales competition (e.g., the X3 and 3 Series take sales from each other as do the RX330 and ES330), (3) there is inter-marque competiton (potential buyers who didn't like the new 7 Series might go for the S Class or people who think the 330i is too expensive might buy a G35), and (4) you have to take into account general economic and social trends (e.g., in general recessions cause sales to fall and buyers have moved away from sedans and station wagons into SUVs and light trucks).

All four factors must be evaluated when comparing a particular marque's sales over time as well as a specific model within that marque over time."

Road Test
Subaru Legacy 3.0Rn
 
No Longer An Outcast
by Ross Finlay (10 Nov 03)

In previous years, Subaru's suggestion that with the latest Legacy it's targeting the ""leading prestige European marques"" would have seemed like PR spin from Cloud Cuckoo Land. But since the 2004 model range offers smoothed-out exterior styling, greatly improved interior presentation, a more powerful top-of-the-range engine and even more precise handling, you'd better believe it.

Subaru may not be the class of the field when it comes to premium badge recognition, but the lighter-weight 2004 model, which goes on sale this month, sits even more four-square on the road thanks to its wider track, modified suspension and lowered powertrain.

Together with revisions to the steering and brakes, lower front and rear roll centres, and the advantage of four-wheel drive, all this means that the top-rated 3.0R feels to have similarly priced European saloons and estates beaten hands-down for handling.

I can't think of any immediate competitors at prices in the mid-£20,000 to £30,000 range which could match them for poise and traction on winding or hilly roads.

The three-litre Legacy is the best-balanced car in its class. Driven briskly, it's stable and precise on corners, and there's no need to throw it about rather than hold it on line. Out on the open road, anybody who feels the VDC cutting in - unless during an emergency attempt to miss the tractor - ought to blush at being so ham-handed.

As I said before, if you have driven a Legacy you know you don't have to worry about keeping up with Audi's, BMW's, G35's or TL's in the twisties. The 3.0r might be getting the 6spd MT from the STI according to Subdriven.com"

Audi? rofl. Audi's A4 Cab is a joke. It's straight up not a sports sedan/coupe. BMW is the only player in the entry level sports coupe convertible market. With everything from the underpowered 325cic to the monsterous M3 convertible, they have the market to themselves.

I'll be amazed if Infiniti doesn't show off a G convertible for the 2005 MY. It's a no brainer given the way the G sells vis a vis the 3.

You'd end up with a 2 seat car. Again that's not competition for the 330cic and for the dough it's not nearly as nice of a car.

A super sprty sedan or coupe is compromised by the top being gone so

The compromise is slight if the engineering is solid. We're talking a marginal weight penalty and if the engineers designed it as a convertible from the start, then the chassis flex is not that much of a difference. 10-20 years ago this wasn't true. Today many sports cars are made from the ground up as convertibles - Z8, Viper, etc.

Have you seen the times on that bloated cow? It's a 4k lbs beast with an underwhelming engine.

Nobody is seriously challenging BMW's dominance of 4 place entry lux RWD convertibles. We know buyers are grabbing up G35 coupes and sedans. So a convertible is the next sensible step in Infiniti's quest to steal BMW's thunder.

Weird, I'm the BMW owner here and you guys seem to think it's a bad idea for Infiniti to offer a RWD convertible 4 place sports coupe."

In their comparison test, C&D could get the M3 to 60 mph only 2-tenths of a second quicker than the S4. Personally, I'd make that sacrifice to save $1500, get 2 more doors, and add AWD.

I think the 1/4 mile is a good test because it mitigates the different gear ratios which distort the 0-60 test (the TSX needs 3rd gear to reach 60 MPH), and lets both HP and TQ come into play.

I don't like the ""top gear"" tests because 5-speed cars have a 1.00 ratio while the 6-speed cars have a much taller ratio (the Saab has .62 in 6th gear, and .75 in 5th).

Fed, nice post. although I question the usefulness of tests that do top gear 50-70. What sort of a person with a performance car would want to do something like that? Honestly, if I'm doing 50, I'm not going to be in anything higher than 4th and most likely in 3rd. If you've got a six speed manual G35 or TL it's expressly because you like to row your own gears.

I think a test that shows 50-70 and 30-50 (isn't this just second gear?) from the optimum gear would tell us more about the cars. Owners quickly figure out how to squeeze the fun from their engines.

Most 5-speed manuals are also overdrive. The IS300 is overdrive. The IS300's overdrive just isn't very deep (believe it is around .85). There are some exceptions. BMW tends to use a non-overdrive 5th gear in their close ratio boxes, but has also used an overdrive in their wide ratio boxes.

You also have to factor in the differential's final drive ratio. The higher the number the quicker the acceleration (but the lower the top speed).

The wonders of engine torque multiplication!

The value of the ""top gear"" data is in regard to showing whether you'll have to downshift in order to pass. The cars with the real deep overdrives (say .70 or lower numerically) normally will have to downshift to 5th or even 4th.

""Top gear"" test also is somewhat indicative of how much torque the engine produces in its power band.

You might also compare C&D's observed and EPA estimated fuel economy numbers. Holding all other factors constant, the cars with the deepest overdrives will (normally) get the best fuel economy and turn over the lowest engine revs at high speeds for relaxed high speed cruising.

The former Acura TL Type-S a great example. Believe it used a 4.11 final drive and a .47 5th gear overdrive. Great initial acceleration and great fuel economy."

Without 6th gear, the ""30-50"" and ""50-70"" numbers for the sub-3.0L cars would all be within a couple 1/10ths of each other (hence the similar 1/4 mile times)."
825,"February 17, 2004 9:02AM",blueguydotcom,"The value of the ""top gear"" data is in regard to showing whether you'll have to downshift in order to pass.

Need to? need? I don't want to take 7 or even 5 seconds to go from 50 to 70. I want to change gears. I want to use the power of my car. I bought a six speed manual for a reason - to exploit the power of the car.

If I'm stuck behind some tool doing 50 I look forward to dropping to third and rocketing by the guy. there's nothing troublesome about that as that's why I bought a car with this much power and a manual.

The cars with the real deep overdrives (say .70 or lower numerically) normally will have to downshift to 5th or even 4th.

I'll take third thanks. I can pull to almost 100 in 3rd so at 60 the car rockets.

""Top gear"" test also is somewhat indicative of how much torque the engine produces in its power band.

At 50 mph in 6th I'd be turning somewhere near 2k RPM. Who drives a car sporting a 7k redline with the engine down there?"
826,"February 17, 2004 9:04AM",blueguydotcom,"TSX runs better than the saab. I'd rather have it and the IS300 looks better in top gear stats as it's a 5 speed i believe.

That's part of the reason the test is bogus. I've driven both cars and the TSX's 6 speed is like butter. Moving to 3rd from 6th is a pleasure and allows the driver to exploit the TSX's spritely little 4. Superb engine and tranny."
827,"February 17, 2004 9:29AM",chrisboth,"TSX to me is a better deal than TL for sure! If only I were younger, smaller and not in traffic. If they had one in 1993 I would have jumped on it.

Although I have not had much luck with acura/honda cars and tranny's as I am way too demanding on their little motors ancd beat the tar out of them, I get the sense the TSX would be up to the task and is a little more than the RSX in capability and fun factor."
828,"February 17, 2004 12:57PM",riez,"blueguydotcom... Is more of a European thing. BMWs, MBs, etc. often used close-ratio (non-overdrive) 4th or 5th gears to ensure adequate response in all gears.

I don't mind downshifting to pass. And I'd rather have better highway fuel economy.

But I will admit it is nice to be driving my '04 IS300 manual in 5th gear and come upon a slower car. I can immediately pass without having to shift. Did same with my former '98 540i6 (believe it had only a .82 6th overdrive)."
829,"February 17, 2004 1:03PM",chrisboth,"I have no issues passing a doof going 40 in a 70 in top gear in the G, but like Blueguy me thinks its funner downshifting to 3rd.

My philosophy is why not hammer the motor - its the one thing that prob will last the longest and you can have more fun too. If when I pass I can get down another gear - WHY NOT. I have a hard time not enjoying all the acceleration this baby's got. If there is any reason to downshift I cant help it - I am addicted to feeling the thrust."
830,"February 17, 2004 1:23PM",blueguydotcom,"Amen. Yeah, we can all press the pedal and build up but we bought performance sports sedans so we could get that giddy jump from 50-80 or even 80-100 in a flash.

Hmmm, so far anyway, it's all been noise. Speaking strictly for myself; the new 5-Series is one of the ugliest cars on the road. Note I said, ""One of the ugliest"", not ""the ugliest"". From my perspective, the CTS is even further down that road, and as such there is no way I would own either of them, even if they had 1000 hp and cost $15K.

Looked at another way; if I were to have opted for the E39 540i instead of my 530i, which really is fast enough, I would be quite happy with the wonderful performance and driving dynamics, regardless of how many folks were out there driving CTS-Vs. Their drivers might well be laughing at me because of my slow 540i; however, I would be laughing right back at folks driving such hideous looking cars. So, who's right? Neither and both, whatever floats your boat. In the end, I seriously doubt that Cadillac is going to do much to BMW sales, besides, with the new Banglized cars; they are doing more to hurt themselves than the rest of the competition combined. :-/

http://thecarconnection.com/index.asp?article=6866&sid=173&am- p;n=156

""Quality problems are still dogging VW vehicles and putting off customers who were attracted to VW in the late 1990s, costing VW big on warranty repairs and marketing costs to keep old customers and lure new ones. Last year, for example, VW began offering costly lease-pull-ahead deals to owners in order to keep them from defecting. In Europe, the company is offering deals like free air conditioning to move a large inventory of Golfs, and similar measures are anticipated in North America. VW stock initially rose 2.7 percent Wednesday, but then gave ground and closed at 39.33 euros ($50.49) or less than one percent in Frankfurt. Shares are down 11 percent since early January. VW is offering discounted finance rates and leases in North America, but has stayed away from big rebates. Most models have rebates of just $500. And it is facing pressure from dealers to be more generous on discounts to move aging models like the New Beetle (five years old), Golf and Jetta (six years old), and Passat (five years old). VW's discounts are more in line with Japanese and European imports than with U.S. automakers. But it doesn't have the premium image of its European mates, nor the high-reliability image of its Asian rivals."""

Nobody said VW doesn't have quality issues. They do, but I don't think their product is as bad as you are making it out to be. VW has an older product line and they are not discounting their cars, and that is why they are being taken to the cleaners by the American and Japanese manufacturers. I was very familiar with VW/Audi products way before I owned one (I hang out at VWvortex a lot). I chose Audi because they are better made and more reliable than their VW counterparts. So far I've had a terrific ownership experience with my A4. Sorry to hear that you had a bad experience."

Differnt values at each co I agree. BUT the new GS and the new IS will change that as well as the cool hybrids and LX470 trucks that youger blingers want. Style is subjective. They sell em without a discount so the ugly aspect isn't there if objectively speaking...and performance will change in fact those co's that put hybrid front drives with gas rear drives in the same car will outperfrom everyone.

I'm not convinced Infiniti has gotten lexus credibility just yet - they just found a young buyers niche only 2 years ago...those weren't young people in those Q's and I's that I saw over the last decade..maybe g20 and then most young people went right to the sentra and saved 15k!"

Two of their complaints I can't get my head around: idrive and lack of nav. iDrive is a snap to use in the 745i (yes I've driven them and used it without a problem) and the new version in the 5 is even more simplistic.

4. All around performance (subjective issue but to me TL is more than just acceleration, slalom 600 67.4 mph). In fact I dont do any of the above just to test my guts, but I know what this car has, so it's kinda comforting thought

5. resale value
   Dont know yet, Acura/ honda always has a good resale value but with all the improvement I think it would be better. with the car's demand is so high, do you think resale value would be bad?

6. Value / what's standard or optional.
   TL comes with 2 prices, 1 with nav and the other without. everything else is standard.

7. simplicity
I guess TL is about simplicity, just voice command it, its faster than having tons of buttons to press"
873,"February 23, 2004 4:50PM",kdshapiro,"danny - seems a little strange, quoting all of those figures, each one of them from a separate magazine and/or source. Taking the best of each number. Just to note, CR got 6.7 to 60 not 5.7."
874,"February 23, 2004 8:00PM",bxd20,"Well, engineering can overcome certain aspects of FWD (torque steer elimination by careful axle length design, wheel spin out of corners with an LSD) but no engineering can overcome the laws of physics.

I think we're all familiar with a tire's contact patch. All forces work through it. When you expect the front two tires to deal with lateral forces of turning AND acceleration/decceleration, the tire becomes overburdened more quickly than with RWD where the fronts just have to roll along and steer.

This type of performance handicap doesn't show up in most performance tests. Acceleration numbers are all straight-line. Skidpad g's are maximized under light throttle adjustments, so it doesn't show up too much there. In slalom, a car's ""normal"" transient behavior is explored and how quickly it can shift back and forth, but the driver is hardly turning left and right in a way that fully collapses the suspension. More importantly though, just like the skidpad tests, the slalom is done with just enough throttle to maintain a smoothe constant speed.

If you want to see where RWD reigns superior over FWD, look at track lapping times. This is where the driver must brake hard, turn in, and blast through and out of the corner. The RWD will be able to get on the gas earlier and harder and gain tenths through the corners. This mimics aggressive street driving more closely than any skidpad/slalom.

look back through the discussion. As I pointed out before, real sanctioned races between cars like the Integra and 3-series don't support your assertion. Search the web and you can find past seasons of ... well ... here's one for you:

As one Sports Car International writer noted (Ted West, 1/02 issue, p. 19): ""in the presence of anything more than puny horsepower, [FWD] torque steer is just plain abominable and something had to be done about it. As with Audi, Volvo believes the answer is [AWD].""

Very powerful FWDers can reduce, but not completely eliminate, torque steer."
877,"February 24, 2004 11:30AM",bxd20,"You're right, I shouldn't have engineering can ""overcome"" torque steer, but rather something along the lines of ""reduce"".

As far as the lapping times are concerned, I don't have much data here at work with me, I will have to take a look at home. I would be willing to bet that the Integra you cite did not have the same power to weight ratio as those RWD cars. My point was -all else being equal- a RWD chassis will be faster around a track.

When super-car builders (Ferrari, Ford GT, Lambo) set out to build an exotic high end sports car, they do so with very little concern for cost. If FWD was inherently equal to or better than RWD, why wouldn't one of them have tried it already? Is Honda on to some sort of voo-doo front wheel drive that nobody else knows about?

And reading over C&D's comparo, it sounds like Acura still has a ways to go till they have the TL handling at its full potential. It finished third because of a wonderful interior and much more power than anybody else. For -me-, the interior is almost irrelevant, any car in this class is good enough. The straight line power is intoxicating and enticing.

I smell a mild suspension update in the next year or two for the TL.

Because they have a lot of time to play with their car or even going to a race track. I was young too.

In my mid 30s, I prefer half sport and half comfort, but if I am over 45, I might go for a total comfort/luxury car.

If you try Nissan maxima or Integra GSR you will feel a noticeable understeer. I am not saying that understeer doesnt exist in a TL but you cant hardly feel it unless you really go too far. ""This time Acura has done a bit too far for a FWD car"" quoted. Do you know what they meant by saying that? I tried Nissan maxima and 2000 Integra GSR (and its nothing compared to TL), and it's totally a different experience but still better than the previous altima. There are 5 current report that gave the nod to the new TL, do you think they all dont know about understeer?.

Performance rating in a scale of 1 to 10, RWD may get a 10 while normal FWD usually get 6. If a FWD can get an 8 (G35=10,BMW=9, TL=8), for me that's more than enough while it gets more rating for luxury/comfort/styling/acceleration/snow/mpg/resale value/ maintenance cost, considering that people dont take on corner very often in their life or doing it in a race track. Besides road styles, traffics in everyday's life dont support those kind of adventure.

Austere is fine. Cold and detached is fine. Doors that are super light (like the nasty BMW X3) or trim that feels brittle (like the Nissan Altima's dash) don't do it for me.

The posts about women could take on on another aspect...do your wives or women friends drive your car and what do they think about the TL and others? Most of the posts here are from men and are performance oriented. Women are responsible for a large portion of the money spent in our economies. I recently read a report that said they were responsible for the majority of the discretionary money spent.
I bought our new TL for my wife. It is the third car I have purchased for her. She never test drives them or participates in the selection. All three have been Acura's. A '91 Legend, a 2000 TL and now an '04 TL. I always look for a car that is a cross between sport and luxury. I am the sport, she is the luxury. She loves the new TL, including the 270 HP. She isn't out racing but is in the car all day driving ( sales job ). The power comes on gradually and is very predictable.
She loves the ""near luxury"" especially the seats and the stereo. The NAV is an absolute necessity as she is constantly having to drive to unfamiliar places. The real thing is she looks very nice in that silver/ebony car and people are constantly telling her what a nice car she drives. On the weekends I get to use the sport piece of the equation. The new TL is a perfect blend for the two of us. After 36 years of marriage I have a pretty good idea of what her expectations are.
I laughed when I read the thread about ""old people"" ( anyone over 30 evidently )not pushing their cars but buying cushy luxury cars. Not always so. I am 58 and still enjoy driving fast and aggressive where it is safe to do so. I started road racing motorcycles at 38. My brother is 60 and has a V8 powered Triumph TR7. Next time your at a light and the guy next to you is in a BMW/TL/??? he may just be like me and decide to have a go. Paul Newman raced well into his 60's.

I think true car guys buy the most performance they can afford, regardless of packaging. If you have a lot of money to blow, then you probably are considering a Porsche 911. But let's say your budget doesn't allow that and you're looking to spend $50k. At that price point, I would be looking at cars such as used M5s, new M3s, a Z06, a CTS-V. I wouldn't ""demerit"" the sedans just because they're sedans. I'd look at overall performance and upon doing so I'd see that the M5 and CTS-V BELONG in the company of ""sports cars"".

As for the sound thing, I'm baffled as to why people think it's out of sorts to want your car to be whisper quiet on the inside.

Currently I drive a 2003 330i with the Performance Package. The muffler makes a constant, droning rasp that reminds me of my sister's first Miata on long drives to So Cal with the top down. The other bimmers I've ridden in are quieter but still there's too much road and wind and engine noise.

It's not too hard to figure out what I prefer given what I bought. The G35 came in 3rd in my choices as I didn't dig the sloppy suspension or typical truck-like Nissan manual. Acura's TL with a 6 speed probably would have come in second as I would have even taken a TSX 6 speed over the G35.

Nothing else was even close as, the Lexus IS bored me with numb steering, a lackluster engine and a very, very bad image in so cal (teen brats drive IS300s around here - the rich kids Jetta\?Accord). Audi's A4 lacks any sort of punch and it has fwd or its god-awful power-sapping quattro (plus I was dropping a VW as they make horrible cars). MB's C class is a joke in terms of handling and power.

if its too quiet, you can't tell what is going on. By the pull of the engine? Ok, so how does that translate as to when to shift? When it stops pulling that means you've hit the rev limiter, so you should shift??

This is one of those things that you should be careful what you ask for because you might get it. I am sure that if you got your wish and had a completely silent car, you wouldn't have a clue what is going on without looking at the guages. Maybe after quite some time with the car, you could get used to what speed objects are traveling past you to trigger your shifting, but it would not be intuitive from the start and would take alot of conditioning.

I am driving a perfect example now. I am currently stuck with a rental 2004 Maxima with the shiftronic.

No I still bought a car with a very bad public image. That fact weighed heavily on my mind before making the trip back to the dealer. I talked to two close friends about it extensively as I'm a torn jeans and old t-shirts kinda guy and the BMW carries a stigma I dislike.

Unfortunately, the IS isn't rare here. It's all over the place and usually travelling in a pack amongst Civics and Integras. I didn't want exclusive. I wanted something not owned pretty much exclusively by modder boys with 19 inch rims and giant spoilers.

3. There is nothing ""numb"" about the IS's steering. More like razor sharp and precise.

Driven two and I'd say the steering is numb. To each his own. You can go round and round on the subjective but neither side can win what feels right to them and not to another. You like it, as Chris likes the road feel of the G35. That's why they make more than just vanilla ice cream.

I'd sooner drive just about anything over a 325i. I think it's a rip off. Why pay 30k for a car with no guts and bad worksmanship? It'd be like owning a VW/Audi again.

So a Toyota Altezza transplant with an iron block 3.0 inline 6 will be a collector's car? Okey dokey. Wishful thinking?

The lack of power and poor steering feel played the biggest role in my decision to pass on an IS. The car didn't excite me. Unlike the G, TSX and BMW 330i, I wasn't smiling while driving the IS... actually I only wanted to get out of it both times.

The desperation of the Lexus dealership who dropped the price to invoice made me uneasy as they called back over and over with lower offers. He was begging me to buy the car. Creepy. Finally, seeing 16-24 year old boys exclusively driving the Lexus IS reminded me of why I passed on the Integra GS-R in 97.

I had the misfortune of piloting a 5 speed CTS with the old engine. It had the so-called sport packaging too. The car bobbed and undulated on hard corners. The interior was a mess, exterior not much better. The dealership seemed really enamored with it being a Caddy. When he asked if I'd buy one I said it lacked the punch and sublime road feel of the German targets. This tool asserted the CTS competes against no one as it's a Caddy. Okay, I guess only pimps would be interested in it then...dunno. He also scoffed at my request for a manual - even though they had one - as he felt Caddies shouldn't have a manual. In the end my experience with the Caddy was a sharp reminder why American car companies should go the way of the dodo."

I agree your experience at the dealership leaves much to be desired.

That said, I have been treated poorly at a Lexus dealership. They were all quite smug acting as if their IS300 was the only sport sedan in town. So I think this attitude comes from certain sales people and not the brand.

When I said ""raw power"", I meant to convey the general ""pull"", or ""kick"" of the car, especially as a reference to 0 to 60 feel. Sorry wrong choice of words.

Also, that 220 you quote is for the 3.2 CTS. The new 3.6 is 255 hp / 252 lb ft torque. That's why I said earlier it will be in the same ballpark as the fastest other RWDs in this class. Of course that's all ""paper racing"", it will be interesting to see what MT or C&D say.

""The Lexus' steering, on the other hand, is exemplary. Not only is it exceptionally tight and precise, with just the right level of power assist at all speeds, but it gives immaculate feedback, as well. The steering wheel itself is fat but small in diameter, and with no supplemental controls save the [AT] gearshift buttons, it's nicely uncluttered, as well. It's perfectly capable of communicating precise information about how much grip is available from the front, what the road surface is doing to the chassi, how much angle is dialed into the wheels, etc.""

40? My car has 235 HP...regardless.

It's the same car, same tranny, same poor BMW reliability.

Actually I have a short-shift 6 speed. Again not the same. Oh and different suspension and different wheels and different differential. Different chip programming. Lets toss in wholly different exhaust system and headers/cams. Oh and my speed is limited to 155 (which I hope one day to try out on a track) rather than 123 (I believe that's the ceiling for the 3 series normally) and my redline is 6800 which is higher than a 325i.

In addition to the performance upgrades from the 325i to the 330i ZHP, I also got a few luxury features I've grown to love...memory seats, tilt mirror. Useless fluff to some but the difference between me happily leaving my car for a wash and being annoyed I have to adjust everything back.

And unless you are a stoplight racer for a living the 0-60mph difference is inconcequential.

I don't know where you live but in So Cal we have annoying freeway lights. 100-200 feet to go from zero to 75.

Am I a stop light racer? No. Do i consistently shift my in the upper region where the engine sings. Redline shifts are common for me on every drive. I bought a performance sedan and I make it perform. I often cruise in 3rd of 4th at around 80 mph so that when the need arises I can punch it and take off. This cannot be done with a 325i. Ask my bro-in-law as he and his 325i simply cannot keep up with my bone stock car.

The 325i has enough power to move that car very well. I personally, think they are both a ripoff, and that's why I went with an A4...but the 330 is by far the biggest insult to one's intelligence.

To each his own. The A4 doesn't offer the handling (especially a FWD one) or power I want when spending over 30k for a car. There's no reason I should EVER have to worry about merging or will I have enough power to shoot a gap if I'm in a near luxury sport sedan. With the A4 (I had a 1.8T) the engine pulls pretty well but not with the ferocious authority I'd expect paying over 30k. Go Quattro and an already slow car is now saddled by an inefficient drivetrain that saps power like crazy. Add the tiptronic and the car's dead in the water.

We all have priorities. Mine were performance, luxury and fun for a price I found reasonable. As the 325i only offered good handling it didn't meet my performance to price ratio. I'd gladly blow 40k again on my sedan as it's a grin producer. The 325i wasn't that big of a step up from my old Jetta. I couldn't rationalize spending 30-32k for a 325i that would leave me constantly annoyed at the lack of punch."

Which means that my response was accurate, if you add back in as much as possible to bring the 325i up to the level of the 330i, you need to add:

Sport Package: $1,400
Harman-Kardon Audio System: $675
On-Board Comuter: $300

That makes the price difference (still not quite apples to apples) only $4,630. That still leaves you with a car with smaller brakes, smaller engine, and a 5-Speed transmission instead of the 6-Speed on the 330i.

Is $4,630 too much for all of that? For me, it's worth it, for someone else it's not. Is it a rip-off? I don't think so.

Regarding the reliability, like virtually every manufacturer in the world, the reliability has improved dramatically in recent years, and statistically speaking, the E39 and E46 cars have improved to such an extent that they are among the best.

No it didn't. That's a typical misrepresentation of the facts. BMW owners do it too. Get a 330i and then add the sport package and 18 inch rims and wheels. At this point you're now talking about a 2k difference for an engine that's modified, modded tranny, different suspension, different interior/exterior treatment. Heck Acura and G35 owners pay 2k just to get cosmetic changes to their cars!

Mine is a 1.8T Frontrack and CVT. The car pulls with tremendous authority and the CVT is a awesome tranny. Previous to my A4, I had a 2K Nissan Maxima (I like a car with power) and I am very impressed with the power of and fuel economy of the 1.8T engine. BTW...I live in S. Florida.

I'm glad you like it. I couldn't live with a CVT or the 1.8T engine again. They're gorgeous cars with excellent interiors and the 1.8T pulls nicely. But I love the neck-snapping ability mixed with the docile nature I can get. With a shift to 3rd I can go from 60 to 95 in a blink and transform my comfy little cruiser into a brutish thug. That's part of why I love my Jekyll and Hyde car.

When it comes to what I prefer with my money I don't even understand how you'd have the temerity to toss up journalists as to proof a vehicle should feel a certain way to me. I never said the rest of the world should bow down to the BMW or Acura or any car. I expressed my opinion on what was worth my money.

Why would I or anyone else take into consideration what dozens of others might have indicated in their published reports when you have spoken?

I honestly don't know why anyone believes a word written in car mags. Or reviews of anything. I judge for myself and make my decision from there. Experience for yourself and build your opinions from that. Repeating quotes from car mags is nothing more than parroting the opinions of someone else. You can tell me X car is horrible but I must experience it for myself.

Good example, I'm a huge movie buff. I've had netflix for near 4 years. I see movies constantly (watch zero TV) and because of my love for film I'll give just about everything a shot - b movies, iranian film, japanese, so-called bombs, etc. With some friends one night we saw an ad for Swept Away on pay-per-view. The common consensus among critics it was horrible. Someone snorted, ""who would see that?!"" I said I had on DVD and it was quite bad. Another friend added, ""Leave it to you to confirm that the universally hated film was bad."" It wasn't good enough that others liked it or disliked it, I had to experience it firsthand.

There can be differences in two cars. Often one test drive isn't enough. Some specific single cars are lemons. Others just aren't up to the rest. Deviations from the mean.

That's why I've driven two of them. You can keep trying but in my experience with the IS300, the car felt numb and disconnected. The engine didn't offer the power I prefer. Like it or not, these are my opinions and I will not deviate from tham."
958,"February 28, 2004 8:00AM",riez,"blueguydotcom... Having owned a '98 540i6 and a '00 323ia, I have some appreciation for BMW steering systems. I've also test driven 318ti, E39 525i, E46 325xi, Z3, X5, E65 745i, etc. (Have you ever done the Susan B. Kosman Drive for the Cure? It is a blast.) I didn't mind fact E39 540i used recirculating ball instead of rack & pinion in the E39 525i/530i. Both work quite well. But I also own two IS300s, an automatic and a manual. The steering in the IS is every bit as good as that in the E39 or E46 BMWs. It is not numb. Nor disconnected. And if it is, then I guess so, too, must be the BMWs?

This is opinion based on actual comparative ownership. Not just a short test drive or two. (I also loved the steering in my former Infiniti G20t and my former Lincoln LS8 Sport.)

I find your following comment fascinating:

""I honestly don't know why anyone believes a word written in car mags. Or reviews of anything.""

Aren't you writing? And essentially providing a review of something? Guess we shouldn't believe a word? I'm a strong proponent of the value of good automotive journalism and subscribe to nearly two dozen automotive publications."

2. The sheet metal will not change but the front and rear bumpers will be totally redone and incorporate the aero kits, or something very similar to them, on both the coupe and sedan models.

It's also a more accurate comparison to compare sales in the same month of the preceeding year since there is an annual ebb and flow to car sales in general. Winter is not exactly the best time to sell a sports coupe or a convertible, for example.

G35 sedan sales up 42% from Feb 2003 sales of 2,410. That comparison is more meaningful.

I'm sure the TL did much better this month when compared to its sales in Feb 2003, but you also have to consider it is an outgoing model vs. a brand new model comparision.

After two years in the market, with all of the complaints about the lack of a manual in its first year, plus ongoing criticisms of the interior (some valid, some not), whether or not the styling will remain ""fresh"", the G continues to sell."

But if I'm a TL owner, I wouldn't necessarily be happy with this, since this means that there are TL's all over the place.

It seems the Maxima increased in sales by a bit (5200). For many Nissan buyers, the Maxima is a viable alternative to the G35 if one is willing to sacrifices some sport for room and FWD (for snow), and is not willing to pay extra for AWD. A fully loaded Maxima and a G35 offer similar features for almost the same price.

BMW sold 2492 325i and 467 330i. This isn't surprising since the 3 is near the end of its model run. Sales will pick up when the next 3 is introduced, but BMW will have to do an excellent job. The TL has been a big success, the G35 will only get better with the redone interior, and Lexus seems serious about the next IS. 3-series domination is no longer a gimme in this segment, as it once used to be.

merc1,

He didn't say when the 05 G35 would be released. But since the 04 G35 and G35 Coupe were released in August 2003, I would guess that the 05 would be released around the same time in 2004."

That's an interesting thing. You're basically saying the Infiniti which hasn't enjoyed good sales over the past 10 years isn't doing well by moving 50-60k units of the G. Most struggling manufacturers would love to offload 30-40k cars in those kind of numbers.

I'd say both cars are a hit. Fair enough?

I'm just itching for an AWD TL 6 speed by May 2006. I couldn't stomach a wrong wheel drive car, so maybe Acura will meet enthusiasts half way with AWD and give us a reason to defect. Ideally let us split the power with a CPU ala the WRX STi...85% rear, 15% front...oh yummy."

I dunno bout you but experts in C&D, motorweek, CR did compare TL with 330i,325i and G35. Chris maybe you are more of an expert, sort of. Who's right then? Whereis maxy?
In fact in edmund 2002-2003 comparison G35 couldnt outsell the previous 3.2 TL, and considered a tie(if not second) after BMW. How can a G35 win over the new TL, how absurd.

G35 is not as fast as TL
G35 is not as well equipped like TL
G35 is cheaper than TL
G35 is not as luxy as TL
G35 does sell less than TL
G35 is not as high tech as TL
What else is wrong with this car, to me is a lot and so to other 6 thousand people who chosed TL, lol. Thats is why only 3 thousands people choose G35, isnt that sad for a so called ""better""/""sportier"" car than TL and its cheaper too, lol. Why dont they buy?

I like stirring the pot lol, tee hee .."
982,"March 2, 2004 11:39PM",jrock65,"""G35 is not as fast as TL""

Disagree. The C&D comparo found the TL to be faster 0 to 60, but the average of the entire sample of tests seems to say that the two cars are a dead heat 0 to 60, and the G35 is slightly faster in the 1/4 mile.

""G35 is not as well equipped like TL""

Depends. The G has some features that the TL lacks, and vice versa. Personally, I prefer the exclusive features of the G, since Bluetooth, DVD-audio, and voice operation (Navi isn't worth it) is useless to me.

""G35 is cheaper than TL""

The base G is cheaper than the TL. But very, very few people get the base G. Similarly configured, the G35 costs a bit more. But I would think that this is a plus for the TL, not a minus.

""G35 is not as luxy as TL""

If by ""luxy"" you mean better interior, then yes.

""G35 does sell less than TL""

No doubt about it.

""G35 is not as high tech as TL""

Yes, the TL has more ""high tech"" features.

Again, I really like the TL and would personally get it over the G35 (depending on how good the 2005 G35 interior changes are.) I just don't think that either is ""better"" than the other in any quantitative sense of the word."

985,"March 2, 2004 11:51PM",merc1,"The TL vs G35 debate.....my take.

Both of these cars are great, naturally you have to open with that line.

The TL looks better (imo), has a better interior, is a hair faster, is fwd (+/- depending) and has more features.

The G35 handles better, stops better, and is rwd (+/- depending).

I think it's really pointless to argue reliability here. Neither will match that ""other"" Japanese luxury brand, per the surveys. They are both competing for 2nd place here.

Price is pretty much a non-issue too, at least around here.

I think it comes down to whether you want more luxury/features or more performance (straight-line speed isn't everything) and rwd handling characteristics.

Neither one of these cars clobbers the other overall.

I still think the G35 coupe is darn sexy and love that angry snarl when you hit it. My old 94' Prelude Vtec was a blast to drive and also had that snarl when the Vtec kicked in around 4500 rpm. I think Acura finally is coming back to life after being neglected by the parent company for so long.
