And, that's on top of any discount you negotiate off the MSRP.

However, the 24/10 residual on the aforementioned GT2 AWD is only 51%, and the MF is .00191, or 4.58%.

The GT2 stickers for north of $50K, IIRC."

Did you hear about the Key FOB scam the dealership and Kia Finance are in cahoots on? Basically, the way it works is they ""doctor"" paperwork behind closed doors to show 1 Key FOB returned, even if you returned two. Then they say the reason you weren't given a return receipt in writing on the drop off date is that the lease manager wasnt' there to do it."

Maybe not... what's the MF and residual?

Edit... just saw that was answered. Like I thought that MF hurts."

I'm pretty sure that's the case with any captive bank.

Not a reason to not lease from the same brand, again."

Any evidence it's a widespread problem?"

So, if my rough math is right, say $50K MSRP, 10K incentive, additional $2K off the sticker, we get $25K residual, i.e. $542 capital payment +$120 financial payment +whatever fees and taxes = $640+fees/taxes/month with zero down, say $700-720 per month on a short term 24-month lease. Similarly priced (MSRP) BMW 3-series (essentially entry level 330) even at higher residual (say 61%,, and lower MF, say 0.00142), if gotten with say $4K off the sticker would probably be slightly more. However, load that bimmer up to get similar equipment and performance and you're adding at least couple of hundred bucks."

And so on the other hand you might consider a 2020 TLX V-6 with super-handling AWD for c. $400 a month with $2500 down, although for that you need to currently have either an Acura or another luxury brand on their list.

I like that. Didn't think of it, but it sounds like an interesting plan. You'll still suffer lousy depreciation, but at least it's mitigated by the huge upfront discount and the buyout can save you some finance charges, if you use cash. If you don't have cash, then it may be better to let the lease run its course unless you can get a really low interest loan, like 2%. What are top tier open market rates for 36-48 month loans now?"
